	  <h1>The Reality of Enso</h1>
	  <div class="date">Tuesday, December 9, 2008</div>

          <p>At 6:30am, at the gentle sound of the Burmese gong, I
          emerged from a deep state of absorption to find myself in
          the meditation hall of the Chuang Yen Monastery in upstate
          New York, surrounded by twenty shuffling men. I hadn't
          twitched a muscle for one hour and hadn't eaten since noon
          of the previous day, but neither stretching nor hunger were
          on my mind. I was aware of one and one thought only, which
          instantaneously pierced the very core of my being:
          everything I had read about the
          Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enso">Enso</a>
          symbol was real.</p>

          <p>I do not mean "real" in a handwavy philosophical sense,
          with a lingering shadow of a doubt that it could be just
          nonsensical "Eastern mumbo-jumbo". I use the word "real" in
          a very physical sense, in the same way one would use it to
          describe a chair, or the beating of one's heart, or the fall
          of the Berlin Wall.</p>

          <p>I saw it with an unprecedented clarity of
          mind. Occasionally, I had approached similar clarity in the
          Russian baths when I jumped from a hundred and fifty degree
          sauna into a pool of ice cold water. The heated body, forced
          to deal with a tremendous temperature gradient, violently
          contracts the blood vessels to preserve heat, ridding the
          mind of every last thought in the process. The baths, the
          sauna, the pool, life's trials and tribulations, victories
          and defeats, are momentarily eradicated from consciousness
          along with the everpresent notion of self, leaving for only
          a few precious moments the magnificent clarity of pristine
          awareness.</p>

          <p>But the clarity of mind induced by the ancient ritual of
          Russian baths disappears as quickly as it appears. For an
          untrained mind it is clarity without insight - a mere
          glimpse of a glimpse of freedom that is possible to
          achieve. It was only with the slow, painstaking effort of
          meditation that my mind was able to relax long enough to see
          for just a few brief moments the reality of Enso and the
          remarkable beauty and harmony it symbolizes.</p>

          <p>Making a pilgrimage from the comfortable Western life of
          fast food and flat screen TVs to the raw asceticism of a
          Buddhist monastery to see Enso is not unlike going on
          vacation from the urban jungle of an inner American city to
          a picturesque European village. Initially, returning to the
          previous way of life seems like a personal sacrifice, but
          after a short while the routine takes over and the memory of
          what could have been dims. In the same way, momentarily
          seeing Enso is only intellectual sightseeing. Being one with
          what it symbolizes every moment of one's life requires a far
          greater effort than moving from the New World to the Old, in
          exchange for a far greater reward. I would trade any
          material fortune to have that clarity always with me, if
          only because I now know that the purity of mind it affords
          would allow me to rebuild this fortune effortlessly. I say
          this because for the contemporary mind this prospect is far
          more attractive than the real gift - that one who has purity
          of mind needs no fortunes.</p>

          <p>So far I've been using the familiar possessive verbs when
          talking about attainment of clarity, but in reality it is
          not a process of acquiring but the process of letting go. It
          is about letting go of the idea that following one's breath
          for an hour is a stupid practice, letting go of the feelings
          of discomfort from sitting on the floor, letting go of the
          tenseness of the large muscles on one's back and the tiny
          muscles on one's skull and face. It is about letting go of
          the desire to move, just a little bit, just this once, and
          of the overwhelming desire to get up and do something,
          anything, anything to avoid sitting quietly with one's own
          thoughts. It is about letting go of furious anger directed
          at the creaking door that keeps stealing one's attention,
          letting go of a dozen itches that inevitably arise all over
          the body, and letting go of the desire to laugh because of
          the absurdity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Then follows letting go of the racing thoughts about
          everything but the breath - thoughts about hunger, and
          what's for lunch, and how you haven't had lunch with some
          friend for a while, and what gift you'll get him for his
          birthday. It's about letting go of the expectation that you
          could follow your breath for a little longer than you could
          before, and letting go of the worrying that your mind is
          filled with so much trash. It's about letting go of
          planning, and remembering, and randomly arising sexual
          images, and the archetypal fantasies of saving beautiful
          women from dire situations in order to win everyone's
          admiration, and fears that one day your parents will pass
          away, leaving you in the world completely alone. It is about
          letting go of everything and just following the breath, the
          beautiful, radiant, subtle, magnificent breath amidst
          infinite emptiness, admiring its gentle tides... only to
          hear the gong and open one's eyes, and remember that you are
          you, sitting on the floor in a room among other people, and
          that you're hungry, and noticing that your leg fell asleep,
          and realizing that you have a million neuroses that you were
          able to briefly let go of by the magic of following the
          instructions left by some ancient sages.</p>

          <p>It is then that you realize that your neuroses, and
          thoughts, and worries, and expectations, and projections,
          and addictions creep into everything you do, from intimate
          relationships, to casual conversations, to writing essays,
          to building software, to sweeping the floor. And you know
          that if you could free yourself permanently from
          restlessness, and dullness, and anger, and lust, and fears,
          and doubt, just like you did for a few precious minutes just
          now, in a twitch of a finger you could amass fortunes, or
          change the world, or paint a perfect Enso, or... you could
          just be content with listening to your own breath.</p>
