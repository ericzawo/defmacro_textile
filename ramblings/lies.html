	  <h1>More On Lies</h1>

	  <div class="date">Tuesday, May 13, 2008</div> <p>Paul Graham
	  wrote an essay on adults <a
	  href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lies.html">lying to
	  kids</a>. After <a
	  href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">What You Can't
	  Say</a>, I expected him to write it. It's very much up his
	  alley. So, when I saw the title, I eagerly clicked on the
	  link and started reading... gradually coming to a
	  disappointment. The essay is about lies adults tell kids
	  deliberately. The word "deliberately" makes the subject far
	  less deep than it could have been, because eventually these
	  lies are easy to identify. And once you see a lie, it loses
	  all power over you. For people with an inquisitive mind, the
	  most harm these lies can do are a few difficult years during
	  puberty.</p>

	  <p>Most people grow out of the little lies parents tell them
	  about sex, death, and cursing. Most intelligent people I
	  know grew out of religious ideals their parents instilled in
	  them. Not in a sense that they teach their children to
	  curse, or that they switched from Judaism to Christianity,
	  but in a sense that they recognized these things as entirely
	  arbitrary. They'll still teach their children not to curse,
	  and they'll go to the synagogue, but they'll do it exactly
	  because they saw through the arbitrary nature of these
	  ideas, and are no longer controlled by them. Once you see
	  that something you do is completely arbitrary, you become
	  free of it, and once you're free there is no value in
	  rebelling against it. There is no conflict in staying
	  religious and recognizing the arbitrary nature of your
	  belief. The corollary of this is that teenagers rebel
	  against their parents precisely because they're still under
	  their parents' control.</p>

	  <p>Far more dangerous lies are the deeply rooted social
	  beliefs parents unconsciously instill into their
	  children. These lies are dangerous because most people, no
	  matter how intelligent or inquisitive, remain oblivious to
	  them all their lives. This is what I was hoping Paul would
	  write about.</p>

	  <p>A good example of this is the "flat Earth model". It took
	  thousands of years for a thought that the Earth may not be
	  flat to enter people's minds. Why? This thought should be
	  simple to generate - all you have to do is recognize that
	  the Earth is flat, and negate this notion. Why didn't people
	  do this? The obvious reason is that people didn't know they
	  thought the Earth is flat. Nobody ever explicitly said it
	  was, the idea was completely implicit.</p>

	  <p>A modern analogy that illustrates this is a famous
	  interview problem: you have a cake with an irregular piece
	  cut out of it, and you have to figure out how to cut the
	  cake into equal pieces. The smarter the person, the harder
	  it is for them so solve this problem. People come up with
	  all sorts of ingenious (and usually incorrect) solutions,
	  when the obvious solution is staring them right in the face
	  - just cut the cake horizontally.</p>

	  <p>Why can't people just think of how we normally cut cakes
	  and negate the procedure, yielding the correct solution?
	  Mostly, because nobody says "could you cut this cake
	  vertically, please?" The notion that cakes are to be cut
	  vertically is so implicit that we can't see it, and if we
	  can't see something, we can't negate it. If we don't know
	  how we cut our cakes, what other implicit assumptions are we
	  blind to?</p>

	  <p>The most dangerous lies permeate everything around
	  us. They're so blatantly banal that we can't see
	  them. Depending on the time period, people who discover
	  these lies are either given a Nobel prize or burnt at the
	  stake (which is also a form of flattery).</p>

	  <p>So what can we do?</p>

	  <p>The most liberating work I encountered so far is <a
	  href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOut-Your-Mind-Essential-Listening%2Fdp%2F1591791650&amp;tag=defmrambonlis-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Out
	  of Your Mind</a> lecture series by <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts">Alan
	  Watts</a>. The CDs are worth every penny of their price
	  (their cover doesn't do them justice).  Of course there are
	  alternative ways of obtaining them (I say this because once
	  you listen to the first lecture you'll immediately be
	  convinced that if Alan were alive he would be absolutely
	  thrilled about the potential the Internet offers, and would
	  be perfectly happy with his work being distributed for
	  free). If you like Paul's work you will love Alan
	  Watts. Their thought processes are two sides of the same
	  coin. (Incidentally, this demonstrates the limitations of
	  modern recommendation systems - Amazon's page for Hackers
	  &amp; Painters does not mention Alan's work, but this is a
	  topic for a different article).</p>

	  <p>Everyone understands that a conscious, reasoning mind is
	  a great blessing. Unfortunately few people understand the
	  flipside - because of the bounds every thought, conviction,
	  and belief impose on us, a reasoning mind is simultaneously
	  a terrible curse. There is a huge body of knowledge on how
	  to identify the deep rooted assumptions, and how to free
	  ourselves from the very real chains our mind imposes on
	  us. All we have to do is enter the <a
