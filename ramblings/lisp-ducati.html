	  <h1>Lisp - The Ducati Of Programming Languages</h1>
	  <div class="date">Monday, January 29, 2007</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">One of the early summer evenings of 2003 I
	  was sitting with a group of friends on a terrace of a lively
	  New York City cafe. The wretched east coast humidity didn't
	  yet settle in and we were enjoying a pleasant warm breeze
	  while watching the flickering lights of cars pass by across
	  the street. The guy sitting next to me was someone I haven't
	  met before - a friend of a friend who happened to join us
	  that evening. He was wearing a motorcycle jacket and had a
	  helmet resting on his lap. Breaking the ice, I asked the
	  first question that came to mind: "So what's it like to ride
	  a bike?" I was genuinely interested but didn't expect to
	  hear anything new. I would be unable to convey to someone
	  the feeling of driving a car so how could I expect him to
	  convey the feeling of riding a bike? A single experience
	  would be worth a thousand words. His answer surprised
	  me.</p>
	  <p>"When you drive a car", he said, "there is a disconnect
	  between your thoughts and the machine. You sense it, but
	  you're never <em>really</em> conscious of it until you get a
	  bike. You want the car to accelerate, you add some gas, and
	  then you have to wait for a split second before the car
	  listens to you. On a bike this delay is so much smaller,
	  your brain doesn't really register it. You think of
	  something, and you're there. A bike becomes a part of you -
	  an extension of your body. You'll probably need a Ferrari to
	  achieve such unity with a car."</p>
	  <p>Then and there I made a resolution to one day learn to
	  ride a motorcycle (first I'd need to get some free time and
	  figure out how to keep it secret from my mom). I thought
	  about the philosophy of mind/machine unity for a few more
	  days until other thoughts took over and the conversation was
	  gradually forgotten.</p>
	  <h2><a id="part_2">Common Lisp</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Learning Haskell was like tackling a new
	  rock climbing track - a slow, challenging, strenuous, yet an
	  extremely satisfying process. When I finally got to a stable
	  spot where I could get some rest I felt euphoric. To keep my
	  neural pathways from irreversibly solidifying on
	  Hindley-Milner way of thought I decided to take temporary
	  leave from Haskell. The next couple of weeks I spent hacking
	  in Common Lisp.</p>
	  <p>One day I mentioned what I've been doing to a friend over
	  lunch. He never understood my affection for "weird"
	  languages - few people ever do. "So what's it like to
	  program in Lisp, anyway?" he asked. Suddenly the three year
	  old analogy was snatched from the dark depths of my
	  memory. "It's like riding a bike", I said.</p>
	  <p>A Common Lisp compiler is not just a tool - once you
	  acquire a critical mass of knowledge it becomes an extension
	  of mind and body. You think of where you want to be and a
	  few keystrokes later you're there. Your mind doesn't have
	  enough time to notice the delay. Hacking Lisp programs is
	  such a fluid process that it's hard to think of the machine
	  as an external entity. Common Lisp is the Ducati of
	  programming languages.</p>
	  <h2><a id="part_3">Haskell</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">When my friend heard the analogy he asked a
	  followup question. "If Lisp is the Ducati, then what is
	  Haskell?" I'm glad he asked it - a newcomer to Haskell,
	  formulating the response helped me drop the final piece of
	  the puzzle in place in my own mind.</p>
	  <p>After some thinking I realized that the transportation
	  analogy doesn't extend to Haskell in a meaningful way. Hacking
	  Haskell programs is not like driving - the fluidity aspect is
	  missing. Lisp lets you think any thoughts and
	  instantaneously communicate them to the machine. Haskell
	  provides a productivity boost in a very different way. It
	  forces you to examine and rearrange the way you think about
	  the problem every step of the way. Lack of fluidity is made
	  up for by architectural guidance. It takes extra effort to
	  write Haskell programs that aren't beautiful.</p>
	  <p>What should you learn first, Lisp or Haskell? It depends
	  entirely on your personality. One thing is certain - if you
	  want to be a great developer eventually you'll have to learn
	  both.</p>
