	  <h1>Zen, or the art of YC interview</h1>
	  <div class="date">Tuesday, November 10, 2009</div>

          <p>So you've agonized over the YC application, crossed your
          fingers, hit that submit button, and chewed your nails to
          the core waiting for the response. Finally, you got that
          precious e-mail inviting you to the YC interview - the
          fifteen minutes that might change the way you think about
          your life forever (it won't actually <em>change</em> your
          life - you'll still be an unemployed ruby hacker with a
          dream, but it will change the way you <em>think</em> about
          it). Finally, the exhilaration has subsided. What now? How
          do you prepare?</p>

          <p>The short answer is, you can't. Wait, what?! Can't? What
          about learning about the market, perfecting the prototype,
          and practicing the pitch? You can do all these things. In
          fact, you <em>should</em> do all these things. But they
          probably will do precious little to change the outcome. You
          see, the YC interview is Zen. You're supposed to sit just to
          sit, but then you're sitting there, thinking that you're
          sitting just to sit, and all of a sudden you realize that
          you're no longer sitting just to sit, but thinking about
          sitting just to sit instead. Confusing? Impossible? Yes. YC
          interview is like that.</p>

          <p>So, if you can't prepare for the interview, why am I
          writing to give advice? I just am. It's like that. The
          cursed Zen again. You better get used to that, because if by
          some miracle you get accepted, you'll face a whole pile of
          Zen paradoxes. Startups are like that, and YC interview is
          just the beginning.</p>

          <p>In all seriousness, you should do as much as you can to
          prepare. The problem is that you've probably built the whole
          thing up in your mind, and when you get there you'll be
          under enormous, self-imposed pressure. Grace under pressure
          is what it's all about. You can't fake your personality when
          the bullets are flying. You can't fake anything - you'll
          just be you. That's what happened to me - we did a ton of
          preparation, read every piece of advice we could find on the
          internet, but the moment we walked into that conference room
          I forgot everything. All that information evaporated from my
          brain, and I was just me. The past twenty six years of my
          life was my preparation. I lost self-consciousness, sort of
          like when you get absorbed into a movie. My heart was
          pounding so hard, I saw everything in red. I barely remember
          a word I said. And it worked, but <em>*I*</em> had nothing
          to do with it. It just happened. I said the only things I
          possibly could have said in that situation, and I suppose
          the partners liked something about it. But I couldn't have
          faked it. If you stay clear-headed, perhaps you can, but I
          couldn't have.</p>

          <p>For us, "interview" was really the wrong word. It goes
          differently for everyone, but Mike and I agreed that the
          proper word is "interrogation". My memory is probably
          playing tricks on me, but I could swear the partners used
          psychological interrogation techniques (unconsciously,
          maybe, or perhaps not). I distinctly remember good cops and
          bad cops, except they switched roles so often I can't figure
          out to this day which is which. (Jessica was always the good
          cop, though).</p>

          <p>It was great. When we came out, my mind was already made
          up. "This was the best interview I've had in my life", I
          said to myself. I even wrote it on a piece of paper, so I
          couldn't weasel my way out of it in case we got rejected and
          my psyche would compel me to change my mind and think the
          interview is lame.</p>

          <p>You've already read six paragraphs of drivel that won't
          help you, so I'll now try to redeem myself and give a few
          useful pieces of advice. I think the worst mistake we made
          was to assume the partners will know to ask the right
          questions. They won't. They don't know anything about what
          you're doing. During our interview, we got distracted by
          some side issue - when we came out, we realized that we
          didn't convey <em>any</em> of the core ideas we wanted to
          convey. We got lucky, but you may not be so lucky. Stay
          conscious throughout the interview, and if you feel you're
          getting into a side issue, gently nudge the partners in the
          right direction. It is <em>your</em> responsibility to get
          the core concepts across, not theirs.</p>

          <p>Don't get flustered by bad cops - they'll push your
          buttons on purpose. Nothing you say will be good
          enough. That's because they want to see how far they can
          push you. Defend your ideas, don't be a pushover, but accept
          valid criticism a few times. Don't be <em>too</em>
          stubborn.</p>

          <p><span style="color: red;">Edit:</span> Paul Graham
          responded <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=933606">here</a>
          and said the partners never play any psychological tricks
          deliberately. So if it feels that way, remember - it's all
          in your mind!</p>

          <p>If you can keep these pieces of advice in your mind
          during the interview, you should be fine. But I couldn't. I
          forgot all of it, and was just myself. You probably will too
          - that's why the most useful thing you can do is not be
          nervous. I realize how ridiculous this sounds. You
          probably <em>will</em> be nervous, and you'll be nervous
          about being nervous, and you'll just end up forgetting it
          all and being yourself. That's OK too. It's a hell of an
          experience - just sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>

          <p>Some of the YC alumni will be there during the interview
          weekend to try and put you at ease. Perhaps I'll see you
          then. In the meantime, I'll leave you with a timeless piece
          of advice from Felix Dennis:</p>

<pre>
The first step? Just do it
And bluff your way through it.
Remember to duck!
Godspeed ...

and Good Luck!
