	  <h1>Why Exotic Languages Are Not Mainstream</h1>
	  <div class="date">Tuesday, August 9, 2006</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first"><a
	  href="http://www.haskell.org"><em>Haskell</em></a> is an
	  excellent programming language.  It has features that allow
	  for a tremendous productivity boost. Type inference figures
	  out and lets you examine types of every piece of code that
	  you write so you don't have to baby sit the compiler, yet
	  you get the benefits of static typing. Functions are first
	  class objects so you can build abstractions without writing
	  useless glue code. The language is elegant and has plenty of
	  syntactic sugar that makes it a pleasure to work with. It
	  even has libraries for things you may want to do in a real
	  world project. So why wouldn't you want to pick Haskell for
	  your projects?</p>
	  <p>A few days ago I was kicking around a few ideas and I had
	  no reason <em>not</em> to use Haskell to build a
	  prototype. Besides, it was time for me to start eating my
	  own <a href="lisp.html">dog</a> <a href="fp.html">food</a>.
	  So I started shopping for a Haskell compiler.  <a
	  href="http://haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> seemed like a good
	  bet - a fast, stable, cross platform, <em>real</em> compiler
	  (not a flimsy interpreter) that would let me create
	  production quality code. And it's free. After downloading it
	  I did something every self respecting Windows programmer
	  would do - I wrote a program that tried to open a
	  window. That didn't work. Well, it did, but it took five
	  (yes, you read that right, five) minutes for the window to
	  open. So I hit the web and found a <a
	  href="http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/742">bug
	  report</a> for this issue.  No solution. I sent an email to
	  the GHC support group and got the following reply<sup><a
	  href="#permission">1</a></sup>:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Unfortunately this code is currently broken with GHC on
	    windows. No one has fixed it because the code is low
	    level, ugly and few people understand it.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>That's no big deal. I figured I'll just download another
	  compiler. <a
	  href="http://cvs.haskell.org/Hugs/index.html">Hugs</a>
	  seemed like a good bet. Ok, so it's just an interpreter, but
	  these days who cares? I downloaded it and tried to run the
	  same program through Hugs. Whoops, an error. Some DLL
	  missing. I hit the web, and found the <a
	  href="http://www.mail-archive.com/hugs-bugs@haskell.org/msg02867.html">following</a>:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>The libraries that ship with WinHugs May 2006 are a
	    fresh build, those with the old version are from a really
	    old WinHugs release, hence the different contents. [...]
	    For the moment you should be able to paper over the
	    problem by copying the old Win32 directory into the
	    packages directory, replacing the new one.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>Hmm, frustrating, but again, no big deal. I downloaded
	  the older version and overwrote the directory. The graphics
	  library finally worked! Now all I needed was an IDE and I'd
	  be well on my way to building my application in Haskell. I
	  searched the web and realized that the number of choices is
	  very small. People seemed to suggest <a
	  href="http://www.haskell.org/visualhaskell/"> Visual
	  Haskell</a> the most, so I gave it a try. The environment
	  was actually really nice, except one issue: I couldn't
	  evaluate expressions from the IDE. This reduced me back to
	  the old style change-recompile-run development cycle and I
	  didn't want that.  Evaluating expressions through the
	  command line involves constantly switching between
	  evaluation contexts manually, so I thought I may be missing
	  something since it's such an essential feature. So I shot an
	  email to the support group for Visual Haskell and here's the
	  reply:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Unfortunately this isn't supported feature. It is
	    highly desirable but it requires lots of work. I am
	    planning a new VSHaskell release but the only new thing
	    that it will have is a support for VStudio 2005. VSHaskell
	    is a noncommercial product without any funding and I work
	    on it only in my free time.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>Bummer.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_2">What's Next?</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Is Haskell a great deal of fun to play
	  with? Absolutely. Does it stretch your mind and make you a
	  better programmer even if you never actually use it at work?
	  No doubt about it. Would I bet my business (and my family's
	  well being) on it?  Looks like the jury is still out.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_3">Feedback</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">After publishing this article I received
	  e-mails from people closely related to WinHugs and GHC
	  development teams. They assured me that the issues I
	  mentioned are being worked on and are taken seriously. I'd
	  like to stress that despite some shortcomings Haskell is an
	  excellent platform for solving many real world problems and
	  it will only improve with time. Additionally it has benefits
	  that mainstream languages can't afford to have: Haskell
	  designers are just an e-mail away. I strongly encourage
	  everyone to look into this wonderful language. This article
	  is not meant to be a deterrent. On the contrary, it's a call
	  to fix superficial issues that act as barriers for
	  adoption.</p>
