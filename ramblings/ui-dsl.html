	  <h1>A User Interface Definition Language in Common Lisp</h1>
	  <div class="date">Wednesday, February 13, 2008</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">I like HTML in the same way I like PDF - as
	  a document serialization format that does a reasonable job
	  and that I never want to modify by hand. This is one of the
	  main reasons I started <a
	  href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/">Weblocks</a>
	  framework - I never wanted to write a line of HTML
	  again. Ironically, I ended up writing <strong>a lot</strong>
	  of HTML and learning more about its quirks, accessibility
	  issues, and CSS hooks than I ever wanted to, but I finally
	  ended up with a high level user interface definition
	  language embedded into Common Lisp. Finally, HTML is out of
	  my life, for good. Being lazy does pay off.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">Defining a User Interface</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">So how does it work? From the perspective
	  of a web application developer it's very simple. You just
	  specify the user interface in a declarative manner and the
	  engine figures out how to convert it to HTML:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview employee-form (:type form :default-method :post)
  first-name
  (last-name :requiredp t
             :label "Family Name")
  (contract :present-as (radio :choices
                          '(:full-time :part-time :consultant :intern))
            :parse-as keyword)
  (age :present-as (input :max-length 3)
       :parse-as integer))
</pre>
          <p>Rendering the object into HTML is then as simple as
          typing the following line:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(render-object-view some-employee 'employee-form)
</pre>
          <p>It's up to the engine to render the form, labels, input
          fields, radio buttons, etc. Reasonable defaults are used
          whenever possible, and when the defaults aren't sufficient
          the developer can declaratively specify how a field is to be
          rendered, how it is to be parsed, how the value of each
          field is to be acquired and stored, etc. The declarative
          language mirrors a set of extensible data structures that
          hold the rendering information, so when new renderers need
          to be provided for an obscure HTML construct I didn't think
          of, the developer can extend the engine with the construct
          once, and forget it ever existed.</p>
	  <p>The language is very flexible. For example, to render the
	  contract choices as a dropdown and to obtain them
	  dynamically we could declare the contract field like
	  this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(contract :present-as (dropdown :choices
                        (lambda (obj)
                          (declare (ignore obj))
                          (list :full-time :part-time :consultant :intern))
          :parse-as keyword))
</pre>
	  <p>Here is an example that defines an interface which simply
	  renders textual information about an employee:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview employee-data-view ()
  first-name
  last-name
  contract
  age
  company)
</pre>
          <p>The type of the view isn't specified because text view is
          the default, nor are there any special options for
          the fields.</p>
	  <p>This works very nicely, but what about reusing views when
	  parts of the website require simple deviations?</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_4">Inheritance And Composition</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">So far we defined a simple UI for an
	  imaginary <em>employee</em> object. However, real life web
	  development is rarely that simple. Most user interfaces
	  involve presenting complex, interrelated objects in various
	  ways. To allow doing this, views provide two abstraction
	  facilities - <em>inheritance</em> and
	  <em>composition</em>.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Inheritance</h3>
	  <p class="first"><em>Inheritance</em> allows one view to
	  inherit fields from another and to selectively override
	  necessary fields. Consider presenting the employee - in case
	  we're on a particular company's directory, we don't want to
	  show which company each employee works for - we already know
	  which directory we're in. However, if we're building a
	  directory of all contractors that work for the government
	  and we stumble on a give employee, we want to know which
	  contractor the employee works for.</p>
	  <p>We could copy-paste the <em>employee-data-view</em> and
	  remove the company field for the company directory view, but
	  a much more elegant way to solve the problem is to have the
	  new view inherit from the old one:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview employee-company-directory-view (:inherit-from 'employee-data-view)
  (company :hidep t))
</pre>
          <p>Now <em>employee-company-directory-view</em> has all the
          fields in <em>employee-data-view</em>, except we override
          the <em>company</em> field and hide it. We can also add new
          fields, if the need arises.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Composition</h3>
	  <p class="first"><em>Composition</em> allows mixing in
	  views. Consider a view to present an address:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview address-form-view (:type form)
  street
  city
  (state :present-as us-state)
  zip)
</pre>
	  <p>It can be used in a large number of settings - as part of
	  the employee profile, company information, credit card
	  payment form, etc. We could have other views inherit from
	  the <em>address</em> view, but we wouldn't get positioning
	  flexibility, wouldn't be able to mix in multiple fields, and
	  would prevent the view from inheriting from other, more
	  relevant views. Composition solves these problems:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview credit-card-form (:type form)
  number
  expiration
  (address :type mixin
           :view 'address-form-view)
  (street :hidep t))
</pre>
          <p>This way the <em>address</em> view is <em>mixed
          in</em>. The fields of the address are presented inline in
          the credit card view. We can mix in as many fields as we
          wish. Additionally, we can override the way address fields
          are presented in the credit card view. In this example the
          street is hidden, as it may not be relevant to credit card
          validation.</p>
          <p>View inheritance and composition provide powerful means
          to define, structure, and customize user interfaces. But can
          things get better? I think they can.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_4">Scaffolding</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">When I heard about a new Ruby framework
	  called "Rails" that automatically generates interfaces from
	  class definitions I was ecstatic. Finally, someone wrote a
	  framework I always wanted to write! A class definition, in
	  most languages, is fairly close to a UI definition language
	  (albeit not incredibly expressive). By default, a tremendous
	  amount of valuable information can be obtained from member
	  names and types, and this information can be used to
	  generate default user interfaces!</p>
	  <p>I downloaded Rails first chance I got. Unfortunately I
	  was in for a disappointment. The framework converted class
	  definitions into HTML. It was a one way script, not a true
	  abstraction. If I modified the generated code, I couldn't
	  update the model and regenerate the interface - my
	  modifications would be lost.</p>
	  <p>The proper way to implement scaffolding, the way that's
	  actually useful throughout the entire project, not merely at
	  the beginning, is to introspect class definitions and
	  generate high level user interface definition data
	  structures that can later be selectively overridden in a
	  declarative manner. We can do that by taking advantage of
	  the inheritance mechanism described above. Consider the
	  following snippet:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defview employee-data-view (:inherit-from '(:scaffold employee)))
</pre>
          <p>Now our view inherits from a scaffold view. The scaffold
          view generates a sensible interface from the CLOS object in
          question. It turns out that Common Lisp class definitions
          are so expressive, very good interfaces can be generated by
          default. Consider the following class definition:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(defclass employee ()
  ((first-name :reader employee-first-name)
   (last-name :accessor employee-last-name
              :type string)
   (contract :accessor employee-contract
             :type (member :full-time :part-time :consultant :intern))
   (age :accessor employee-age
        :type (or null integer))))
</pre>
          <p>We can gain an incredible amount of information from this
          definition. We know that we have four fields: <em>first
          name</em>, <em>last name</em>, <em>contract</em>, and
          <em>age</em>. We know that <em>first name</em> should be
          read-only, as only a reader is defined for the corresponding
          slot. We know that <em>last name</em> and <em>contract</em>
          should be required fields, because their type signature
          doesn't permit for nulls. Similarly we know that
          <em>age</em> should be optional, as null is permitted, and
          that it must be an integer. We also know that
          <em>contract</em> can be one of four values.</p>
	  <p>The class definition is so succinct, one may wonder why
	  not use CLOS classes in the first place without defining a
	  custom language. In fact, this is the route I took
	  initially, only to find out later that it doesn't work. The
	  same object is often rendered in different ways, and people
	  aren't very fond of changing their data model to change the
	  way a field is rendered. I also couldn't define a custom
	  metaclass so that specialized rendering information for each
	  slot could be put in place. Firstly, more often than not
	  model classes already have a custom metaclass to allow for
	  mapping to a backend store, and secondly this wouldn't
	  easily accommodate creating multiple different views of the
	  same object.</p>

	  <p>Every field we define in <em>employee-data-view</em>
	  overrides the fields automatically defined by the scaffold
	  view. We can hide fields defined by the scaffold by setting
	  <em>:hidep</em> option to true, set custom presentations and
	  parsers, and change every other parameter. Of course
	  interfaces can be defined without the use of
	  scaffolding. But why would anyone want to do a thing like
	  that?</p>
