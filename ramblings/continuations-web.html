	  <h1>Continuations-Based Web Applications in Common Lisp With Weblocks</h1>
	  <div class="date">Tuesday, November 20, 2007</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Whenever I have to write convoluted code to
	  express a simple idea, I instinctively try to avoid doing
	  work. The corollary of this is that every time I reach for
	  my inbox during coding, there's a pretty good chance I need
	  an abstraction I don't have.</p>
	  <p>I suspect this is true for most programmers, not just
	  myself. If this is so, GMail owes most of its load to web
	  application programmers. Writing web applications sucks for
	  a number of reasons (most of which, I think, are fixed by <a
	  href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside</a> framework, it's
	  only peril being that it forces people out of Emacs). Top
	  three biggest problems that I encountered are managing data,
	  managing UI state, and managing control flow.</p>
	  <p>Web frameworks made great strides in solving half of the
	  first problem. ORM layers provide a reasonable (though not
	  ideal) solution by automatically mapping data to the
	  database. To date no framework that I know of other than <a
	  href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/">Weblocks</a>
	  does the other half of the work and automatically maps the
	  data model to portable, accessible, standards compliant
	  UI<sup><a href="#scaffolding">1</a></sup>.</p>
	  <p>A few frameworks do a reasonable job managing UI
	  state. The best example of a widely adopted framework to do
	  this is ASP.NET. <em>ViewState</em> and <em>Page_Load</em>
	  are terrible ideas, and because delegates aren't true
	  closures writing a good ASP.NET component quickly takes you
	  on a path to warm, inviting arms of heavy narcotics, but at
	  least they set out in the right direction (pun intended). <a
	  href="http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/">UCW</a> and
	  Seaside do this well. Weblocks does this. Pretty much any
	  framework based on components instead of MVC and template
	  engines does this well.</p>
	  <p>Aside from Weblocks, three frameworks I know of do a good
	  job dealing with control flow - Seaside, UCW, and <a
	  href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT</a>. Proper control
	  flow management is difficult to implement - it requires
	  continuations, which most languages don't support. Because
	  frameworks with good control flow management are so rare,
	  most people don't understand what they're missing. In this
	  article I'll describe the problem and how it is solved in
	  Weblocks using continuations. A live Weblocks demo that
	  showcases a practical implementation of these concepts is
	  available <a href="http://72.249.76.121/">here</a>.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">The Problem</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Control flow management in web applications
	  rears its ugly head in two situations: modal interaction and
	  sequencing.</p>
	  <p>Modal interaction is anything that involves feedback from
	  the user before the application can move on. Consider action
	  confirmation: user tries to delete something and the
	  application needs to present him with a confirmation
	  dialog. It's possible to simply show a JavaScript popup, but
	  what if the client has JavaScript turned off? The proper
	  solution of returning another page (or code via AJAX) is
	  surprisingly complicated. The server needs to store the
	  current operation somewhere and redirect to the confirmation
	  page. If the user doesn't confirm the action, the
	  confirmation page needs to redirect back to the original
	  page. But what happens if the user confirms? In a less
	  powerful language we have the option of faking closures with
	  a myriad of design patterns, or of hard coding the necessary
	  operation in the confirmation page itself. In a more
	  powerful language we can use closures, but then we're forced
	  to write programs in a continuation passing style. That
	  wouldn't be so bad in this situation, but it becomes less
	  and less practical when sequencing is involved.</p>
	  <p>Sequencing is a series of nested modal interactions,
	  potentially with branches. Presenting a series of license
	  agreements, going through a shopping cart checkout process,
	  paying your credit card in a series of steps, and approving
	  someone's timesheet are all examples of sequencing. This is
	  workflow - the part of the application that gets things
	  done. Because sequencing can be thought of as a series of
	  modal interactions, all the problems outlined in the
	  previous paragraph apply to every step of the sequence as
	  well. Without closures doing this and still maintaining
	  sanity is not possible. With closures this is more
	  comfortable but not ideal - unless you have three widescreen
	  monitors the indentation will quickly make long workflows
	  very difficult to maintain.</p>
	  <p>An elegant solution for these problems involves using
	  first class continuations if they are available, or
	  transforming code to CPS style. Because Common Lisp doesn't
	  provide continuations out of the box, I wrote <a
	  href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-cont">cl-cont</a>
	  - a library that transforms selected pieces of code to
	  CPS. Let's see how this works in Weblocks in practice.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_3">Handling User Actions</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Before we get to continuations, let's first
	  discuss how Weblocks deals with user actions. When the user
	  clicks on a link or a button, what happens? Weblocks makes
	  this really easy - you simply render functions into
	  appropriate HTML. For example, a link can be presented to a
	  user like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(render-link (lambda (&amp;rest args)
               (declare (ignore args))
               (do-something))
	     "Some Link")
</pre>
          <p>The lambda function is stored in a hash table with a
          unique string as its key. The link with text "Some Link" and
          the key in the reference is presented to the user. If the
          user clicks on the link, the key is looked up in the hash
          table, and the function is retrieved and called. Because
          we're using a link, in this case we can safely ignore
          <em>args</em>. If we were rendering a form instead, we'd use
          keyword arguments to access parameters passed with the
          request that interest us.</p>
	  <p>The implementation of <em>render-link</em> makes the link
	  asynchronous by default - the callback is invoked via
	  AJAX. If the client has JavaScript turned off, a regular
	  request is used instead. AJAX can be turned off by passing
	  <em>:ajaxp nil</em> to <em>render-link</em>.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_4">User Actions And Continuations</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Now let's consider modal
	  interaction. Suppose "Some Link" takes the user to content
	  that requires authentication. Normally we'd have to go
	  through a two phase redirect ritual, and right about now
	  we'd be opening GMail. With proper flow control we can just
	  express our intentions in an elegant and straight forward
	  manner:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(render-link (lambda<strong>/cc</strong> (&amp;rest args)
               (declare (ignore args))
	       (if (<strong>do-page</strong> (make-instance 'my-login-widget))
	           (show-protected-content))
                   (show-error))
	     "Some Link")
</pre>
          <p>We call <em>lambda/cc</em> instead of <em>lambda</em> in
          order to turn on CPS transformation for our action. We then
          call <em>do-page</em> with the login widget as the
          argument. This is where continuations shine. At this point
          the continuation is saved and the user is taken to a new
          page and shown a login box. When the login widget decides if
          the user can be authenticated it must call <em>answer</em>
          with the result - a function that will restore the saved
          continuation. At this point <em>do-page</em> will return as
          if it were a simple function call, and generation of the
          original page continues. Our handler for "Some Link" can
          then choose whether to show protected content or an
          error.</p>
	  <p>A lot could be written about <em>lambda/cc</em> and
	  <em>do-page</em>, but that would be an article about
	  implementing a CPS transformation in Common Lisp, and using
	  delimited continuations to implement interesting
	  things. This is somewhat complicated. But once the
	  functionality is in place, using it is as simple as the code
	  snippet above.</p>
	  <p>Weblocks provides a number of primitives built on top of
	  continuations. One such primitive is <em>do-choice</em> - a
	  function that presents a modal dialog with a number of
	  choices the user can pick from. On top of <em>do-choice</em>
	  there is <em>do-confirmation</em><sup><a
	  href="#do-confirmation">2</a></sup> and
	  <em>do-information</em> - functions that let the user
	  confirm an action and review information, respectively.</p>

	  <p>Before we move on to sequencing and workflows, let's talk
	  a little about user interface state management and
	  widget-based approach to web applications.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_5">UI State Management And Widgets</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Technology is the limiting factor of
	  ideas. Web 1.0 was powered by ASP, C++, J2EE, and
	  occasionally, when after six months of trying people
	  realized they <em>still</em> can't reliably instantiate a
	  stateful session bean, Perl. It shouldn't come as a surprise
	  that most of the failing Web 1.0 applications were glorified
	  shopping carts - it took about two million dollars to build
	  an online store.</p>
	  <p>Web 2.0 is powered by MVC. We've transcended shopping
	  carts. MVC lets you build really simple applications really
	  fast. The idea is that simple applications is what people
	  want. I suspect that what people really want, <a
	  href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400063515?tag=defmrambonlis-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1400063515&amp;adid=05PHFZ0GYVFP0XTGFV4P&amp;">Black
	  Swans</a> aside, is simple UI to really complex processes
	  that take up their time and money - something that cannot
	  easily be done with MVC, the way it is normally used.</p>
	  <p>As the applications get more complex, managing state of
	  user interface components becomes more and more
	  difficult. At some point one runs into a complexity
	  asymptote that cannot be crossed without jumping to a
	  different abstraction. Components (or widgets) provide an
	  abstraction that allows crossing this invisible line.</p>
	  <p>Perhaps the best way to illustrate the componetized
	  philosophy is by example. Weblocks provides a number of
	  widgets to perform common operations. <em>Dataform</em>
	  widget allows the programmer to present the data to the
	  user, let the user click "Modify" to see a form and modify
	  the data, let the user submit or cancel the changes, and
	  return to the data view. All in one line of code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(make-instance 'dataform :data some-employee)
</pre>
          <p>Another example is an automatically sortable, pagable
          grid of items. In Weblocks I can create one like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(make-instance 'datagrid :data
               (list some-employee-1
                     some-employee-2
		     some-employee-3)
	       :data-class 'employee)
</pre>
          <p>The biggest advantage of widgets is that they maintain
          their own state. I can place a dozen <em>datagrid</em>
          widgets on a page and let the user sort them in different
          ways and go to different pages. There is no central place
          that must keep track of this state - each widget instance is
          responsible for itself.</p>
	  <p>Widgets are composable. For example, a Weblocks
	  <em>gridedit</em> widget uses <em>datagrid</em> and
	  <em>dataform</em> to allow the user to add items to the grid
	  and drill down on existing ones. This paradigm can be
	  extended to the entire application. A <em>composite</em> is
	  a widget that simply holds a list of other widgets (possibly
	  including other composites), to be rendered in order. A page
	  is simply a composite widget with other widgets laid out
	  inside.</p>
	  <p>This approach allows for very complex (from the
	  programmer's point of view) user interfaces that can be
	  easily implemented and reused. In component based frameworks
	  I can take an entire application and embed it into one of my
	  widgets without affecting any part of my application. Code
	  reuse doesn't get any better than that!</p>
	  <p>Another benefit is free AJAX support (the framework
	  simply sends updated widget HTML to the client) which
	  automatically degrades if JavaScript is turned off. But I
	  digress.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_6">Sequential Control Flow</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Let's consider a simple workflow scenario -
	  displaying three license agreements in a row. At each step
	  the user has an option to agree or decline - if the user
	  agrees we move on to the next agreement. If he declines, we
	  show an error page. Normally each step would contain logic
	  to redirect to the next step. In a simple scenario this is
	  uncomfortable because the workflow isn't described in a
	  centralized place. In a more complex scenario with branches,
	  maintaining the workflow becomes a nighmare.</p>
	  <p>Let's see how this can be done in Weblocks:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(with-flow (composite-widgets (root-composite))
  (if (and (yield agreement-1)
           (yield agreement-2)
           (yield agreement-3))
    (show-protected-content)
    (show-error))
</pre>
          <p>The macro <em>with-flow</em> expands to the boilerplate
          code necessary to make the transformation possible. The
          first argument to the macro is the location in the widget
          tree where the agreement widgets should be placed. In our
          case the agreements will take up the entire page - the root
          of the tree. From there we write regular code, using
          <em>yield</em> to present each step. As with
          <em>do-page</em> before, each agreement widget is expected
          to call <em>answer</em> to return control. In this case each
          widget should return a boolean value. If the user ever
          chooses not to abide by the agreement, the <em>and</em>
          expression short circuits and we show an error. If the user
          abides by all three agreements, we show the protected
          content.</p>

	  <p>Note that at any given time we can have multiple flows in
	  different parts of the application (or page). Each flow is
	  independent from the others, and is saved and restarted as
	  many times as necessary.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_7">What's Next?</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">While continuations are initially difficult
	  to understand, using them when they're wrapped in a higher
	  level of abstraction is easy. There is no reason to suffer
	  through artificial redirects and adhoc state machines that
	  simulate control flow. Grab <a
