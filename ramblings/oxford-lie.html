	  <h1>Talking Down To Customers</h1>
	  <div class="date">Wednesday, January 3, 2007</div>
	  <p>As a consumer I can't stand being lied to. When a company
	  lies to me I make every possible effort to end my
	  relationship with them (which, unfortunately, doesn't leave
	  me with many options). What I hate even more than lying is
	  being talked down to. It seems like almost every large
	  company does it to greater or lesser extent to their
	  employees as well as their paying customers - together the
	  most valuable assets a company could possibly hold (unless
	  it's sitting on an oil field or has a monopoly on mining
	  diamonds).</p>
	  <p>This strategy is usually recognizable the moment you
	  have to communicate with them. First, in a detached, formal
	  tone, as if there isn't a single living human being working
	  for the company, they tell you how much they value your
	  business and how hard they're working so you get the bang
	  for your buck. Immediately after that, they contradict
	  themselves making you feel like a five year old child.</p>
	  <p>Today I received a letter from Oxford Health Plans which
	  is a little gem that perfectly illustrates how <em>not</em>
	  to communicate with customers. I guess the MBA who
	  approved the letter slept through the class that addressed
	  this particular issue. Here is a small excerpt:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Providing you with comprehensive access to a broad
	    network of laboratories is our priority. Periodically, we
	    evaluate our network and relationships to ensure that they
	    continue to offer the quality, convenience and
	    affordability that you have come to expect.</p>
	    <p>...</p>
	    <p>Effective January 1, 2007, Quest Diagnostics will no
	    longer participate in the Oxford Health Plans provider
	    laboratory network.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	  <p>The first paragraph explains that there is a
	  faceless corporation working around the clock to get
	  me and my family cheap, high quality testing. The paragraph
	  immediately after that tells me that they've cancelled their
	  contract with the largest diagnostics company in the United
	  States, the one pretty much all doctors in my area have
	  favored for as long as I could remember.</p>
	  <p>The letter ends with a warm reassurance that I could
	  contact Oxford and they'll resolve all my problems:</p>
	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Our goal is to make this transition seamless for you
	    while continuing to deliver the quality, affordability and
	    choice that you have come to expect. If you have questions
	    about these changes or need additional assistance, please
	    call Customer Service at the toll-free number on your
	    Member ID card.</p>
	  </blockquote>

	  How nice. They'll be glad to talk to me but
	  provide no address or e-mail and I'll have to make an effort
	  to find their phone number (a brilliant appeal to people's
	  laziness in an attempt to keep to a minimum a mountain of
	  phone calls that are sure to follow). If I ever get around
	  to calling them the person on the other end of the line will
	  likely have no clue what I'm talking about - she didn't
	  write the letter and doesn't make the decisions. No, I
	  can't talk to the person who makes the decisions. No, I
	  can't talk to the supervisor, he's on vacation. No, there
	  are no extensions, I'll have to call the general
	  customer service number and ask for Mary. And we all know
	  what would happen if I did have call back. No, Mary
	  doesn't work here, we have many different call centers.
	  Sorry sir.</p>
	  <p>Oxford can afford to do this - most of their members are
	  customers indirectly, through the employers. I can't switch
	  my health insurance company if I wanted to. Nevertheless, my
	  good faith in Oxford is ruined. All they had to do was write
	  a letter in a way that makes me feel like there is a living,
	  breathing person behind it, and tell me the truth - that
	  their contract with Quest got too expensive and the cost for
	  them is so high they made the tough decision to
	  inconvenience their customers. Who needs to go to business
	  school when the real business lessons are a mailbox
	  away.</p>
