	  <h1>A Lambda Calculus Reducer</h1>
	  <div class="date">Sunday, February 24, 2008</div>
	  
	  <p>About a month ago I decided to buy some time from society
	  by doing a trial run of graduate studies - I took some
	  Computer Science courses at Stony Brook University. The
	  first homework for the Programming Languages course was to
	  write a lambda calculus reducer - a task I happily jumped
	  on. A few hours later I had it implemented in 105 lines of
	  <a href="reducer.hs">Haskell code</a> (for short tasks like
	  these I find that Haskell is a better tool than Common
	  Lisp).</p>
	  <p>The reducer expects a lambda expression. It echos back
	  the way the expression was parsed, and then proceeds to
	  print reductions until it finds a normal form. Here is a
	  trace of an argument applied to an identity function:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
runhaskell reducer.hs
> (\d.d)a
((\d.d) a)
a
</pre>
          <p>Writing a short tool like this is an excellent way to get
          a reasonably good understanding of lambda calculus,
          functions as first class objects, purity, and laziness. For
          example, a snippet below provides a great illustration for
          partial evaluation:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
> (\a.\b.c a b)i
((\a.(\b.((c a) b))) i)
(\b.((c i) b))
</pre>
          <p>Normally when I learn a new programming language I write
          a Lisp interpreter in it - it's a reasonably small, self
          contained task that doesn't take too much time, yet it is
          complex enough to afford a reasonably good understanding of
          the new language by the time you're done. I think for quick
          introductions I'll replace Lisp interpreters with lambda
          calculus reducers (of course one could argue they're two
          sides of the same coin) - they're slightly less time
          consuming and contain enough complexity to give a good
          overview of a programming language in question.</p>
