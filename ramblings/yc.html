	  <h2><a id="part_2">The Advice</a></h2>
          
<pre class="source-code" style="padding-left: 1em;">
Those who know, don't speak. Those who speak, don't know.
<span style="margin-left: 35em;">-Lao Tzu</span>
</pre>
	  <p>It is said that the Silicon Valley attracts a lot of
	  smart people. This is a half-truth. Aside from the smart
	  people, the Silicon Valley attracts a lot of people in
	  general (after all, I'm here!) Meeting many people and
	  sifting through their advice is incredibly important - I
	  don't think it's possible to build a successful business
	  without a team of competent mentors willing to spend time
	  with you. Since we
	  started <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com">RethinkDB</a>, a
	  large chunk of our job has been distilling advice of
	  hundreds of people and integrating it with our vision in
	  order to build a great product. We quickly found out that
	  Lao Tzu was right when he said, <em>"those who know don't
	  speak, and those who speak don't know."</em></p>

          <p>Over the course of the last three months we had the
          privilege to meet a few people whose advice is full of gems
          every time, people that are an exception to Lao Tzu's
          ancient wisdom. I can say with utmost sincerity that
          everyone in the <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
          Combinator</a> team is that exception. Between Paul's
          incredible business acumen, Jessica's warm encouragement,
          and Trevor's and Robert's technical expertise, I couldn't
          dream of better advisors. I would expect to have to travel
          across continents to meet such high quality people, but in Y
          Combinator they're all under one roof. When we applied, we
          spent considerable time discussing how much of the company
          we're willing to give away. Looking back at these
          discussions makes me smile - the advice alone is well worth
          the price of admission.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">Transforming the fear of failure</a></h2>

          <p class="first">What stops you from declaring to friends
          and family that you're quitting what you're doing in order
          to follow your dreams? In many cases the answer is financial
          hardship, or existing obligations. But in most cases the
          answer is fear of failure, or more precisely, fear of public
          embarrassment. This is a tremendous force, a force that will
          keep you on your knees forever, or propel you to the sky if
          you learn how to master it. Y Combinator transforms this
          force from a weight on your shoulders that keeps you down,
          to a powerful rocket that propels you to the sky.</p>

          <p>Before we got into Y Combinator I couldn't bring myself
          to tell people I decided to take a leap and start a
          company. What if it failed? I would have to go back and
          admit failure, and even worse, be embarrassed at admitting
          that I should have taken everyone's perfectly rational
          advice to stay in grad school. When we got accepted to Y
          Combinator, telling people was easy - we got accepted to the
          best seed program in the U.S. Not going would be stupid.</p>

          <p>Now that I took the leap, I can't easily go back and
          admit failure. Fear of public embarrassment is now working
          <em>for</em> me. I knock on doors I would never have had the
          courage to knock on before, and I do things I never would
          have done, all because I can't go back and admit
          failure. I'll accept failure only as the last resort, after
          every other avenue has proved to be a dead end.</p>

          <p>This doesn't just transform your company. It transforms
          your life. How much are you willing to pay for that?</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">The application</a></h2>

          <p class="first">The good news is that getting into Y
          Combinator is probably not as hard as you think. Pitch your
          business to a dozen strangers, and carefully record every
          objection they bring up. Answer the objections in the best
          way you can. Rinse, repeat. After a few iterations, you will
          truly understand your business, inside and out. Filling out
          the application will be a breeze.</p>

          <p>Once you've filled out the application, send a few of the
          YC companies an e-mail. We'll be happy to review it. Getting
          in was hard for us, and we'd love to make it easier for
          you. You can go a long way with a little bit of
          feedback.</p>

          <p>That's really all it takes. If you diligently go through
          this process, I would be genuinely surprised if you didn't
          get in. At the very least it will help your business - this
          is something you probably should be doing
          anyway. <a href="http://ycombinator.com/w2010.html">What are
          you waiting for?</a></p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">If you don't get in</a></h2>

          <p class="first">Y Combinator can't make you succeed. Paul
          can only show you the door. You'll have to assemble a team
          of advisors on your own, but most YC companies do it anyway
          - even the smartest people have limited expertise. You'll
          have to get your own contacts, but most YC companies do that
          too. The only truly difficult thing you'll have to do on
          your own is conquer your fear of failure. I didn't have the
          courage to do it without YC, so I have no advice on that. I
          do wish I had done it earlier. It's hard. I hope you find
          the courage to do it.</p>

          <p>Take the plunge. Believe in yourself and in your
          destiny. Let the historians sort out the rest.</p>
