          <p>There was a time in my life when I couldn't get anything
            done. I was studying many different subjects at once, from
            theoretical Computer Science, to Zen, to principles of
            graphics design, when I developed a perception of deep
            underlying beauty of all things. Suddenly I could tell
            beautiful code from ugly code, a beautiful design from
            ugly design, and beautiful writing from ugly writing.</p>

          <p>I could always do this to some degree, but this time the
            sense of beauty (or its lack) felt far stronger and more
            refined than ever before. It was so strong that I found
            myself unable to complete any serious tasks. Whenever I
            sat down to implement my vision (whether by coding, or
            writing, or designing), I'd find that what I produce
            inevitably falls short. The code was too crude, the
            writing too clumsy, and the design too ugly. No matter
            what I did, there would be something essential missing
            from my implementation, and I could never put my mind on
            what it was. Producing anything took forever, and
            ultimately I discarded it all because it just wasn't good
            enough.</p>

          <p>What is worse is that not only was my work not good
            enough, it was also not important enough. After I'd work
            on something for a while, a doubt would inevitably creep
            in and convince me that what I'm doing is irrelevant on
            any reasonable scale. My work was always a flawed,
            irrelevant vision with a crude implementation. Why bother
            doing anything at all, then?</p>

          <p>Perfectionism, which was always a friend, turned into my
            worst enemy.</p>

          <p>I've heard that "perfect is the enemy of good enough"
            many times, but the repressed artist in me refused to
            accept this as truth. I was stalled in a proverbial
            checkmate that my mind has cunningly set up for itself and
            I could see no way out. And I desperately needed a way
            out, lest I be stuck in endless cycle of consumption
            samsara. I knew
            that <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Real_Artists_Ship.txt">real
            artists ship</a>, but I refused to ship mediocre work,
            which meant I could never ship anything.</p>

	  Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers" /></a>

          <p>Eventually I lucked out. By accident (or was it an
            accident?) I stumbled on the fascinating
            <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0877739188?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=defmrambonlis-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0877739188">Book
            of Tea</a> which led me to the concept
            of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a>
            - the Japanese art of imperfect beauty. Wabi-sabi is a set
            of philosophical principles that relate Buddhist concepts
            that can be observed in meditation to all aspects of
            design. For the first time it occurred to me
            that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha">Dukkha</a>
            (the fundamental lack of satisfaction with anything in the
            physical
            realm), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicca">Anicca</a>
            (impermanence, lack of any "timeless" principle), and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta">Anatta</a>
            (lack of "self", or the idea that any object can be
            complete in and of itself and exist separately from the
            subject) apply to all things we create.</p>

          <p>Looking at Wabi-sabi objects was a breath of fresh
            air. Inability to achieve any lasting perfection is not
            fought, but embraced via lack of symmetry, respect for
            blemishes, and unsanitized simplicity. Imperfection,
            impermanence, and incompleteness is incorporated directly
            into the design - a simple idea that cuts the disease of
            perfectionism at its core.</p>

          <p>Everything about this article is flawed - what I intended
            to say has an absolutely essential piece missing, the
            writing is poor and doesn't express my vision well
            (however imperfect that vision may be), and it probably
            doesn't matter in the long run. But I'm publishing it for
            all to see.</p>

          <p>Real artists ship.</p>
