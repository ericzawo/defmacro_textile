	  <h1>On Haskell, Intuition And Expressive Power</h1>
	  <div class="date">Friday, December 15, 2006</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">An imperative programmer learning Haskell
	  goes through a number of stages. One of these stages is
	  frustration with perceived lack of productivity. I say
	  perceived because the feeling is fraudulent - <del>basic
	  qualitative analysis</del> a little bit of thinking<sup><a
	  href="#manager-speak">1</a></sup> reveals that in this case
	  human intuition is inconsistent with reality. Confused?
	  Allow me to explain.</p>
	  
	  <p>This stage hits you by surprise. With some persistence
	  you inevitably get good enough to be able read, write, and
	  understand Haskell programs and decide to write something
	  relatively big in Haskell yourself. At some point you catch
	  yourself staring at the screen and realize that you haven't
	  typed a single character in many minutes. Not because you're
	  procrastinating or daydreaming - you <em>are</em> thinking
	  about the problem. And not because you don't know how to do
	  something in Haskell - you <em>do</em> know. After a while
	  you realize that this happens more and more often, in fact,
	  it's the usual state of affairs when programming in
	  Haskell. This results in a very frustrating experience - an
	  imperative programmer's intuition tells you aren't being
	  productive.</p>
	  
	  <p>It takes quite a bit of time to get used to the idea that
	  more thinking and less typing is a blessing rather than a
	  curse. You don't stop typing for minutes at a time because
	  you're not being productive. You stop typing because Haskell
	  is incredibly expressive - one line of Haskell code is often
	  equivalent to dozens of lines of Java or C++. You end up
	  spending almost the same amount of time thinking about the
	  problem regardless of the language but with Haskell you
	  spend a lot less time (and space) expressing the problem in
	  terms a computer can understand.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">Expressive Power</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Here's an example from something I've been
	  doing for a prototype of a web application. This piece of
	  code goes through a parse tree of Haskell source code,
	  locates every reference to an identifier that ends with
	  "Widget", puts it on a list, and removes duplicates so every
	  identifier is represented in the list only once. I did this
	  to avoid writing boilerplate code every time I create a new
	  servlet.</p>
	  
	  <pre>
extractWidgets :: (Data a) => a -> [String]
extractWidgets = nub . map (\(HsIdent a)->a) . listify isWidget
    where isWidget (HsIdent actionName)
              | "Widget" `isSuffixOf` actionName = True
          isWidget _ = False
	  </pre>

	  <p>It took me quite a bit of time to write this piece of
	  code. Considering how long it took to write these five
	  lines<sup><a href="#no-guards">2</a></sup> it may seem
	  that I wasn't very productive. However, if we consider how
	  much this tiny paragraph of code does, a different picture
	  begins to emerge.</p>

	  <p>Let's see. The first line tells Haskell that
	  <em>extractWidgets</em> should accept one argument of any
	  type (that's what lowercase <em>a</em> means), and should
	  return a list of strings. <em>(Data a)</em> says that only
	  types that belong to a class <em>Data</em> should be
	  accepted for the first parameter. This is Haskell's way of
	  saying that no matter what type is passed to
	  <em>extractWidgets</em> it must expose an interface defined
	  by <em>Data</em>. This property will be verified by Haskell
	  at compile time.</p>

	  <p>The dots in the second line suggest that we should read
	  it from right to left. The rightmost expression (<em>listify
	  isWidget</em>) returns a function that takes a single
	  argument. Whenever someone will call <em>extractWidgets</em>
	  with an argument, this argument will really be passed to a
	  function returned by <em>listify</em> (this is currying at
	  work). At this point this function will examine this
	  argument, iterate through its terms (sort of like reflection
	  can iterate through member fields), and will call
	  <em>isWidget</em> on each term only if the type of that term
	  is the same as the type <em>isWidget</em> accepts (this type
	  happens to be <em>HsName</em> and the compiler will infer it
	  automatically). The function will return a list of all terms
	  for which <em>isWidget</em> returns true. We'll get to the
	  definition of <em>isWidget</em> in a little bit, but on a
	  high level it checks whether an identifier ends with the
	  string "Widget". Haskell will then apply the expression
	  between the dots (<em>map (\(HsIdent a)->a)</em>) to the
	  list returned by the function described above. In functional
	  programming <em>map</em> is like a <em>foreach</em> - it
	  iterates (maps) over a collection, applies a function passed
	  to it to each element of the collection, and returns a new
	  collection with transformed elements. In our case
	  <em>map</em> maps through all the identifiers that end with
	  "Widget" (that's what the rightmost expression returns,
	  remember?) and applies a function that simply converts
	  <em>HsIdent</em> to <em>String</em> so we get a list of
	  strings as a result. The function to do that (<em>(HsIdent
	  a)->a</em>) is so simple that we don't need to give it a
	  name - we simply create it inline via <em>\</em> - Haskell's
	  operator to create unnamed (lambda) functions. Finally we
	  take this list and pass it to the first expression on the
	  line - a function called <em>nub</em>. Now, what in the name
	  of all holy is <em>nub</em>? Here's where Haskell shines -
	  not only does it teach you functional programming, but also
	  some vocabulary! <em>Dictionary.com</em> defines
	  <em>nub</em> as "the point, gist". The function returns the
	  gist of the list, which amounts to the list with duplicates
	  removed so every item appears on the list only once.</p>

	  <p>The last three lines actually define the function
	  <em>isWidget</em>. Keyword <em>where</em> means that the
	  function is local to <em>extractWidgets</em> - it will not
	  be seen by any other function. As you already know
	  <em>isWidget</em> takes one parameter, but not just any
	  parameter. We're only interested in the ones that have a
	  type of <em>HsName</em>. Now, Haskell names may take shape
	  of identifiers and symbols. For the purposes of this
	  exercise we're only interested in identifiers and we
	  specify that by matching the argument against a pattern
	  <em>(HsIdent actionName)</em>. If the pattern matches,
	  Haskell goes on to check the guard specified by <em>|
	  "Widget" `isSuffixOf` actionName</em>. This is like an
	  <em>if</em> statement that checks whether "Widget" is a
	  suffix of <em>actionName</em>. If and only if the pattern
	  and the guard both pass, does the function return
	  <em>True</em>. In all other cases it returns
	  <em>False</em>. Note that we match all other cases via a
	  pattern <em>_</em>. This way we tell Haskell that we don't
	  care what the argument is, we already know we need to return
	  <em>False</em>, but we could easily add more patterns and
	  guards if we needed to.</p>
	  
	  <p>It's also interesting to note why <em>isSuffixOf</em> is
	  wrapped in back quotes. In Haskell every binary function
	  may be used with regular prefix syntax (<em>isSuffixOf
	  "Widget" actionName</em>) or as an operator (<em>"Widget"
	  `isSuffixOf` actionName</em>). The latter is accomplished by
	  wrapping the function with back quotes. In this case using
	  <em>isSuffixOf</em> as an operator simply makes the code
	  more clear.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_3">The Challenge</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Imagine that you're writing a method that
	  receives a JavaCC parse tree of Java source code and you're
	  trying to accomplish the task outlined at the beginning of
	  the previous section. You have many options to go about
	  solving this problem and all of them will result in code
	  much longer than the five lines presented above. You will
	  likely spend much more time than I did in order to do it in
	  Java, your code will be harder to read, less abstract, more
	  error prone (Java's type system simply lacks the expressive
	  power to represent and verify something like
	  <em>listify</em> at compile time<sup><a
	  href="#type-systems">3</a></sup>), and harder to
	  maintain. But look on the bright side. You'll sure do a lot
	  more typing!</p>

	  <p>Go ahead, give it a try. The first guy to
	  write a complete Java method that does this in five lines or
	  less of reasonably normal looking Java code<sup><a
	  href="#lawyers">4</a></sup> gets a free (as in beer) book
	  of his choice:</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_4">Challenge Update</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">The challenge was won by Jonathan
	  "nostrademons" Tang. He emailed me his solution only a few
	  hours after I published the article. While the solution
	  doesn't meet the rules of the challenge to the letter, in my
	  opinion it is close enough to declare Jonathan a winner. I
	  fully reproduce his post with the solution <a
	  href="haskell-productivity/solution.txt">here</a>. I
	  encourage everyone to examine it - it perfectly highlights
	  the differences between Java and Haskell programming
	  styles. Note that the Haskell solution is significantly more
	  maintainable - it does not depend on the parser's data
	  structures or a particular method of iteration. It only
	  depends on a single data structure of interest - the one
	  that represents the symbol. Congrats to Jonathan for winning
	  a copy of <a

	    <p><sup><a id="manager-speak">1</a></sup>Sorry. My boss
	    speaks this way at work and unfortunately bad habits are

	    <p><sup><a id="no-guards">2</a></sup>Lee Butterman kindly
	    pointed out that the use of the guard is unncessary:</p>
<pre>
extractWidgets :: (Data a) => a -> [String]

    where isWidget (HsIdent actionName) = "Widget" `isSuffixOf` actionName

	    <p><sup><a id="type-systems">3</a></sup>I have nothing
	    against dynamically typed languages - they solve the
	    problem of typing differently, which is fine. However, if
	    I'm coding in a statically typed language, I prefer one
	    with a type system that doesn't suck.</p>
