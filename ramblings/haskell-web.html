	  <h1>Haskell and Web Applications</h1>
	  <div class="date">Tuesday, February 6, 2007</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2> <p
	  class="first">Lately I've been spending a lot of my free
	  time on writing a web application in Haskell. Originally I
	  planned to write one big article documenting the effort but
	  once in a while I end up doing things that are so cool I
	  feel like a fourteen year old girl who just got her first
	  cellphone for Christmas - I just can't shut up about it. One
	  of these things is generic introspection of data structures
	  (more commonly referred to as reflection) and its
	  application to rendering data structures into HTML in
	  generic manner.</p>
	  <p>In most web applications I've worked on a huge chunk of
	  development time ended up going into doing repetitive
	  work. Of course most smart people refuse to do what
	  computers can do and hence in recent years many frameworks
	  popped up that largely succeeded in automating most
	  repetitive chores about building web applications. Perhaps
	  the most famous technique is RoR's "scaffolding" -
	  introspecting data structures to generate boilerplate code
	  that makes the process of building basic web front ends
	  automatic. If you've ever wondered how to do something
	  similar in Haskell you've come to the right place.  Grab
	  some coffee, sit back, and enjoy the ride.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">The Problem</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Essentially all web applications have some
	  data structures that represent the concepts an application
	  is attempting to model. This data needs to be presented on
	  the front-end in various ways: as a detailed information
	  pane, a form, a summary, etc. After writing code to
	  transform data structures into HTML we end up realizing that
	  much of the code is extremely repetitive - aside from rare
	  special cases the code does the same thing over and over
	  again. Consider the following data structure:</p>

<pre class="source-code">
data User = User {
       firstName :: String,
       lastName :: String,
       title :: String,
       age :: Int
   } deriving (Read, Show, Typeable, Data)
</pre>

          <p>We've just defined a user that has a first and last name,
          a title, and an age. We may want to present this data
          structure in the web browser like this:</p>
          <div class="source-code">
             <span>First Name:</span>
             <span>Joe</span>
             <br />
             <span>Last Name:</span>
             <span>Average</span>
             <br />
             <span>Title:</span>
             <span>Programmer</span>
             <br />
             <span>Age:</span>
             <span>33</span>
          </div>
	  <p>Using the following HTML:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;First Name:&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Joe&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Last Name:&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Average&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Title:&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Programmer&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;Age:&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span&gt;33&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	  <p>This is simple enough. If we have to do this often
	  (which, more than likely, we do) we'll write a routine to
	  automate the task of rendering the <em>User</em> data
	  structure in the way described above. However, consider what
	  happens when we define another data structure (say,
	  <em>Company</em>). The way we render it to HTML is not very
	  different than the way we render <em>User</em>, we only
	  change the fields. If we want to abstract this behavior (you
	  <em>do</em> abstract this behavior, don't you?) we have to
	  write a generic routine that works on any data
	  structure. This isn't very hard to do with reflection but
	  the trick is to automate the rendering in a way that allows
	  to easily handle special cases when they arise. We need to
	  be able to specialize our code for particular data
	  structures, otherwise we can't use the framework for real
	  world applications - we'll be stuck the minute we hit a
	  special case.</p>
	  <p>Fortunately all this (and a lot more) is very easy to do
	  in Haskell. In a few dozen lines of code we'll create a
	  flexible, extensible framework that allows us to do
	  everything described in this section and more. Let's catch
	  our breath and move on!</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_3">Type Reflection</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">In order to render an object of type
	  <em>User</em> (or any type, for that matter) in a generic
	  manner into HTML we need to be able to get a list of its
	  field names at runtime. We also need to be able to correlate
	  the field names with their respective values. In Haskell
	  this is pretty simple. The following Haskell snippet takes a
	  generic data structure and returns a list of tuples where
	  each tuple contains a field name and its value in the
	  structure:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
introspectData :: Data a => a -> [(String, String)]
introspectData a = zip fields (gmapQ gshow a)
    where fields = constrFields $ toConstr a
</pre>
          <p>If we run <em>introspectData</em> on a sample user we'll
          get a list that contains everything we need:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
introspectData someUser
-> [("firstName", "Joe"),
    ("lastName", "Average"),
    ("title", "Programmer"),
    ("age", "33")]
</pre>
          <p>The hard part is done. We can now take this list and
          easily convert it to HTML. However, before we get to the
          renderers, let's discuss two more utility functions. The
          function <em>renderFieldName</em> converts a camel case
          field name into a human readable string:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
renderFieldName = capitalize . unwords
                      . groupBy (\_->not . isUpper)
    where capitalize (x:xs) = toUpper x : xs
</pre>
          <p>It's easiest to describe its behavior with a couple of
          examples:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
renderFieldName "firstName"
-> "First Name"
renderFieldName "title"
-> "Title"
</pre>
          <p>We also define a helper function <em>mapFields</em> that
          we'll be using in our renderers. It simply takes a function
          and a data object as arguments and applies the function to
          each field/value pair in the data object.</p>
<pre class="source-code">
mapFields renderField i =
    concatHtml $ map renderField (introspectData i)
</pre>
          <p>Now that the utility code is out of the way let's get to
          the fun part - rendering HTML.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_4">Generic Renderer</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Let's define a function,
	  <em>renderData</em>, that will take a data object and render
	  it to HTML using helper functions defined in the previous
	  section:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
renderData :: (Data a) => a -> Html
renderData i = thediv &lt;&lt; mapFields renderField i
    where renderField (name, val) =
        thespan &lt;&lt; renderFieldName (name ++ ":")
        +++ thespan &lt;&lt; val
                +++ br
</pre>
          <p>The first line says our function will take any type that
          belongs to the <em>Data</em> class and will return a value
          of type <em>Html</em>. The <em>Data</em> class is really a
          set of functions that expose the reflection
          mechanism. <em>Html</em> is a type that's defined in a
          Haskell library along with a number of domain specific
          operators for expressing HTML within Haskell source
          code. Note how we use <em>thediv</em>, <em>thespan</em>,
          <em>br</em>, <em>&lt;&lt;</em>, and <em>+++</em>. These
          operators allow us to output HTML markup from within Haskell
          in a concise way without ever messing with strings.</p>
	  <p>The function <em>renderField</em> renders each field - we
	  pass it to <em>mapFields</em> so it's called once for each
	  field in our object. The function <em>renderData</em> merely
	  wraps our field output in a &lt;div&gt; (we only need to
	  specify the tags once, the library closes them for us
	  automatically).</p>

	  <p>We now have a nice way of rendering objects generically,
	  but what about specialization? Suppose we want to render an
	  <em>Address</em> data structure and we don't want the state,
	  city, and zip code in separate <em>span</em>s because it
	  makes styling our HTML uncomfortable. We could simply create
	  a different function for rendering addresses -
	  <em>renderAddress</em> but that would force us to use a
	  different function name every time we want to render a
	  specialized data structure. Can we do better?</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_5">Specialized Renderers</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Now that we've dealt with the crux of the
	  problem let's take care of the details. A major problem with
	  rendering all structures in a generic manner is that the
	  user interface will feel clunky - while most data structures
	  are handled in the same way there are always special cases
	  that need to be handled separately. Consider the address
	  data structure mentioned above:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
data Address = Address {
       street :: String,
       city :: String,
       state :: String,
       zipCode :: String
   } deriving (Read, Show, Typeable, Data)
</pre>
	  <p>If we use the generic mechanism outlined above to render
	  an address we'll end up with city, state, and zipcode
	  presented on separate lines. This detail won't make or break
	  our application but the UI won't have the polish our users
	  have grown to expect.</p>
	  <p>These cases are very easy to handle by creating
	  <em>specialized</em> instances of our renderers. Remember
	  how the renderers defined earlier are based on a <em>type
	  variable</em> - they take any type and render it using
	  reflection. We can create specialized instances that work on
	  specific types. All we have to do is add a type class for
	  rendering data and changing the behavior for
	  <em>Address</em> will be a piece of cake!<sup><a
	  href="#redo-generic">1</a></sup></p>
<pre class="source-code">
class Data a => DataRenderer a where
    renderData :: a -> Html

instance DataRenderer Address where
    renderData i = ...
</pre>
          <p>Now every time we try to evaluate <em>renderData</em>
          with a piece of data of type <em>Address</em> Haskell will
          call our specialized instance!  Every time we need
          specialized behavior we can simply define it once and it
          will automatically be used throughout our application. Note
          that Haskell compiler figures out which instance to use at
          <em>compile time</em>. Not only do we get virtual functions
          on steroids, we also don't need to take the performance
          hit<sup><a href="#performance">2</a></sup>.</p>
	  <p>It's rather interesting to contrast Haskell's type
	  classes with Alexandrescu's techniques to achieve "compile
	  time polymorphism" presented in Modern C++ Design. This
	  comparison would be far beyond the scope of this article
	  but I encourage everyone to do it on their own.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_6">Multiple Renderers</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">What's interesting about web applications
	  is that the same piece of data may be presented to the user
	  in many different ways. We may present information about a
	  user in a form, or simply as lines of text, or in a single
	  row of a table. In order to illustrate the flexibility of
	  our approach, let's create another generic renderer that
	  renders Haskell data structures into HTML forms. We'll
	  follow the process outlined above. First we'll create a type
	  class for rendering forms:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
class Data a => FormRenderer a where
    renderForm :: a -> Html
</pre>
          <p>Then we'll create a generic renderer instance:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
instance Data a => FormRenderer a where
    renderForm i =
        form ! [method "post"] &lt;&lt; (mapFields renderField i
                 +++ button ! [name "action", value "submit"]
		     &lt;&lt; "Submit")
        where renderField (name, val) =
	    thespan &lt;&lt; renderFieldName name
            +++ textfield name ! [value val]
                +++ br
</pre>
          <p>At this point we can take any Haskell data structure and
          render it into HTML in different ways in one line of
          code!</p>
<pre class="source-code">
-- Render the data structure
renderData someUser

-- Render into a form
renderForm someUser
</pre>
          <p>Sing, goddess, the eulogy to the old ways of writing web
          applications, which put pains thousandfold upon the the
          programmers. Manual HTML generation is no more<sup><a
          href="#new-way">3</a></sup>.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_7">What's Next?</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">While the code presented in this article
	  exposes a very powerful approach for generically rendering
	  data into HTML, it currently has limitations that need to be
	  addressed. It only renders "simple" data structures - ones
	  with a single constructor and primitive
	  fields. Additionally, the code does not contain a generic
	  way for consistently dealing with relationships - an
	  employee that contains a field with a company id will render
	  an integer instead of the company name. Also, the renderers
	  described in this article expose no mechanisms for
	  customizations - <em>renderData</em> renders structures in
	  the only way it knows how. It seems fitting to parametrize
	  standard renderers to allow larger degree of
	  flexibility.</p>

	  you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please

	    <p><sup><a id="redo-generic">1</a></sup>We'll also need to
