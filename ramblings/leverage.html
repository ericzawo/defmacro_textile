	  <h1>The Universal Law of Leverage</h1>
	  <div class="date">Saturday, October 10, 2008</div>

          <p>Statistics suggest that most successful startup founders
          have three failures under their belt before they make it
          big. It doesn't have to be that way. While nothing can
          replace hard-earned experience, people <em>can</em>
          and <em>do</em> learn from other people's mistakes. I'm a
          firm believer that a couple of simple (in hindsight) lessons
          can significantly increase the overall success rate. In this
          article I want to talk about <em>leverage</em>. I think that
          in at least half the failures I've seen (my own as well as
          others), misunderstanding the mechanics of leverage played a
          key part. First, let's take the cat out of the bag:</p>

<pre class="source-code" style="margin-left: 9em; margin-right: 9em;">
The probability of you getting leverage in a given situation is
inversely proportional to how much you need it.
</pre>

          <p>This isn't a philosophical statement at all. It is a
          universal law of nature (probably from the sociology realm),
          and is as real as gravity, conservation of energy, or, to
          give a slightly more relevant example, supply and demand in
          economics. It applies to countries, businesses, and
          people. If you absolutely need a defense ally to keep your
          enemies at bay, you're probably not going to get one. If you
          need a partner to successfully distribute your software to
          customers, none will be in sight. And, to use the infamous
          dating analogy, if you're really desperate to find love,
          you'll have to keep waiting.</p>

          <p>The inverse of this also tends to be true. If you're
          perfectly capable of defending your borders on your own,
          you'll have dozens of countries pledging support. If your
          software sells just fine on it own, potential distributors
          will barge down your door. And if you already have a partner
          or are perfectly happy staying single, you'll have plenty of
          opportunity to get dates. (This last part hasn't been true
          for me. There are exceptions to every rule.)</p>

          <p>This is a fairly simple concept, and yet, every day
          people start companies with business plans that depend on
          cooperation of key suppliers, or outside funding, or a chain
          of other highly unlikely events. The reason, I think, is
          psychological. People don't want to believe this simple
          truth, because it makes things hard. So they go on living
          the way they lived, waiting for their big break.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">Big Breaks</a></h2>
          <p class="first">"But wait a minute!", I hear you
          say. "People do get big breaks!" Yes, they do. People win
          lotteries left and right too. It's just extremely unlikely
          that it's going to be you. But even the big breaks that we
          see happen around us probably aren't big breaks at all.</p>

          <p>The first problem, is that most people that appear to
          have gotten a big break, actually didn't. They went through
          months, or years, of grinding away, until they started
          seeing signs of success. Then they had their break - at
          precisely the time when they didn't really need it
          anymore.</p>

          <p>The second problem, is that most breaks aren't actually
          big. They're little, welcome pieces of luck that
          occasionally come your way. They help, but they don't
          propel you into the sky, they just temporarily help you get
          a little higher. The trouble is that once you get one or two
          of these, you'll keep designing your business to depend on
          more. And while you can (and probably will) get a few pieces
          of luck, the probability that you'll get twenty breaks in a
          row until you finally hit it big is infinitesimally
          small.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_2">Learning To Fly</a></h2>
          <p class="first">The good news, is that leverage is like
          gravity. When you first understand gravity, you'll probably
          get discouraged from ever attempting to fly. But with a lot
          of careful thinking and hard work, you can use gravity to
          your advantage to propel you into the stratosphere.</p>

          <p>There is a lot of careful balancing involved. It's ok to
          depend on getting leverage, but you have to make sure you
          don't depend on it before the time is right. You'll have to
          get the first little taste of success without any leverage
          whatsoever. Set up the proverbial lemonade stand, so to
          speak. Once you sell some lemonade, you'll get a tiny bit of
          leverage - you'll be able to open a pretty good bank
          account, or even may be get a small loan. You'll buy more
          lemons. Make more sales. You'll then be able to get some key
          ingredients at wholesale prices, so you can scale a little
          better. More profits. You'll open another stand. And just
          when you're about to figure out how to scale out the whole
          thing, you'll get a call from Safeway. "Could you be our
          lemonade supplier?"</p>

          <p>But think of what would happen if you depended on the
          call from Safeway on day one.</p>
