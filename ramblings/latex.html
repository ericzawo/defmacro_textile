	  <h1>What is LaTeX and Why You Should Care</h1>
	  <div class="date">Sunday, October 08, 2006</div>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_1">Introduction</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Every time there is a link to a resource
	  even remotely related to academia, it's available only in a
	  weird format that looks like it was invented by Martians
	  three thousand years ago while they were stuck on a strange
	  planet light-years away from home. It's never something you
	  can easily open - it's not HTML, not a Word document, not a
	  text file. You're lucky if it's PDF. Most of the time it's
	  PostScript or a mysterious DVI format that nobody outside of
	  a select group of High Priests of Martianic Church knows how
	  to open.</p>
	  <p>Reading the article ends up being a scavenger hunt for
	  utilities found on obscure FTP mirrors of some .edu domains
	  that end up having a user interface from Stone Age. While
	  you search for these utilities you will undoubtedly see a
	  few references to LaTeX which at first glance appears to be
	  some document format invented by the aforementioned group of
	  homesick Martians and requires ten pages just to explain
	  what exactly it is it does. When you finally manage to open
	  the file you're greeted by a word "abstract" instead of a
	  word "summary" and as you try to scroll through the article
	  you find that the scroll wheel abruptly stops at the end of
	  the first page. You glance at the toolbar to find a "next
	  page" button and see a row of various arrows with no
	  immediately decipherable meaning. This is the final
	  straw. You curse the ivory towers inhabitants in all known
	  tongues for wasting ten minutes of your life, close the
	  document without ever actually really looking at it, and go
	  on with your life trying to block this painful encounter
	  forever.</p>
	  <p>That's a pity. A little bit more persistence and you
	  would have discovered a document processing nirvana.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_2">PostScript</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">The first thing critical reading courses
	  teach is that analyzing a piece of text involves analyzing
	  its author's <em>intent</em>.  Who is the author? What is
	  the target audience? Why is the author writing to the target
	  audience in the first place? If you're trying to understand
	  a piece of writing, answering these questions is half the
	  battle. For example, the target audience for a blogger is
	  anyone who will listen. Bloggers tend to write to drive
	  traffic as high as they can either to make money off
	  advertising and affiliate programs, or to become famous, or,
	  as yours truly, as part of a treacherous secret plot to take
	  over the world.</p>
	  <p>Of course academic writers aren't bloggers. They couldn't
	  care less about traffic or adsense. Most of the time they
	  have too much on their minds to think about becoming
	  famous. They're not even trying to take over the world. The
	  only thing they dream about in the showers and in their
	  sleep and on their way to work is <em>getting
	  published</em>.</p>
	  <p>Whenever someone tries to go anywhere in academia beyond
	  the undergraduate degree, they hear this phrase far more
	  than they can handle without going insane. "I need to get
	  published."  "Are you published?" "Where is he published?"
	  Published, published, published. The Holy Grail for anyone
	  in academia is getting published in a prestigious journal in
	  their field. If you're a graduate student, that's what you
	  need to get a PhD someone except your mother will care
	  about. If you already have a PhD, that's what you need to
	  get a job as a professor in a good university. If you're
	  already a professor, that's what you need to get and keep
	  government grants for research. Even if you're an
	  undergraduate, publishing an article nobody will ever read
	  in a journal nobody has ever heard of can help you get into
	  a good graduate program.</p>
	  <p>So, if you're an academic writer, you aren't going to
	  write your article for the general public. You aren't even
	  going to write it for fellow scientists. You're going to
	  write it for people who hold your academic future in their
	  hands - <em>the journal editors</em>. And journal editors are
	  a very particular bunch that likes to receive submissions
	  that adhere to strict guidelines.</p>
	  <p>I am not familiar with the dark underworld of journal
	  publishing so I won't get into details, but the idea is
	  simple. The work of the editors eventually ends up on the
	  table of folks called <em>the publishers</em>. These are the
	  people that take a piece of text, feed it into printing
	  machines, get thousands of copies, and distribute them to
	  subscribed recipients. The publishers couldn't care less
	  about what they're printing - they just want to get it in a
	  format that their printing machines understand. And this
	  format isn't a Word document.  Because publishers deal with
	  huge volumes and very different types of documents, they
	  want to receive them in a very specific format. A format that
	  tells them <em>exactly</em> how and where to print every
	  dot. They don't want to hear anything about paragraphs of
	  text or tables of numeric values. They want to know how many
	  inches from the left margin should the printer put the first
	  dot and at what offset to put the next.</p>
	  <p>Now, back to the journal editors. Every day their mailbox
	  contains dozens of submissions from every poor shmuck that
	  wants the honor of being published in their periodical. They
	  have to read through the submissions and only pick the best
	  work to make sure they don't print something that doesn't
	  make sense and make their journal look stupid<sup><a
	  href="#bad-entries">1</a></sup>. The last thing they want to
	  deal with is converting the submissions from whatever exotic
	  format the authors decided to write them in to whatever
	  peculiar format the published requires. So the journals set
	  strict guidelines - you can only send submissions in
	  PostScript or DVI (which incidentally turn out to be the
	  formats their publishers accept).</p>
	  <p>Of course if you're Albert Einstein you can engrave your
	  submission on a piece of rock, ship it to the journals via
	  FedEx, and make them pay the bill. They'll be head over
	  heels to accept it and do the format conversion work. But if
	  you're Joe Mediocre, Ph.D., submitting your tenth paper in
	  ten years on individual differences versus social dynamics in
	  the formation of aquarium fish dominance hierarchies<sup><a
	  href="#wasteful-research">2</a></sup> to account for how you
	  spent public funds granted to you by the NSF, you better
	  submit your paper in PostScript. You know what'll happen if
	  you don't. You won't get published this year, the NSF will
	  take your grants away, you'll get kicked out of the faculty
	  without tenure (why keep you around if you don't bring in
	  any research money?), and you won't be able to
	  unconditionally get university pay for the rest of your life
	  without ever actually producing useful work.</p>
	  
	  <h2><a id="part_3">LaTeX</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">These days there are add-ons for Microsoft
	  Word that allow you to save your documents in PostScript. In
	  the old days, when Word wasn't available, people used a
	  format called LaTeX. It was a structured human readable
	  format not unlike XML. People wrote their documents in text
	  editors using LaTeX tags to specify sections, subsections,
	  paragraphs, etc. After they were done with their document
	  they ran it through a program that used stylesheets
	  (conceptually not very different from CSS) to render a LaTeX
	  document into another format (more often than not the end
	  result was PostScript but it could just as easily have been
	  HTML, PDF, DVI, etc.) Back then if you didn't like LaTeX you
	  were forced to use it for a number of reasons. There were no
	  other alternatives to generate PostScript files. Even if you
	  could create one directly, different journals expected
	  different formatting to fit their overall style. The only
	  way to accommodate this requirement was to use LaTeX along
	  with the stylesheets the journals provided<sup><a
	  href="#latex-styles">3</a></sup>.</p>
	  <p>Now that the old days are long gone and word processors
	  come preinstalled with every machine, why should we care
	  about this remnant of history?  The answer is that
	  remarkably LaTeX is much better suited for composing and
	  distributing most types of documents than any other modern
	  word processor on the market that I am aware of. Just like
	  programming languages tend to converge towards Lisp because
	  it got things right the first time around, so do the Word
	  Processors tend to converge towards LaTeX.</p>

	  <h3>Separation Of Markup And Presentation</h3>
	  <p class="first">When I started writing articles for
	  <em>defmacro</em>, I did it in Microsoft Word. This was the
	  word processor I've used since high school, throughout
	  college, and at work. I saw no reason not to use it for
	  writing articles for this website. I soon discovered that
	  I'm not being very productive. It turned out that when
	  writing documents that have valuable content - documents
	  that cannot be written in a single evening and that people
	  might want to read (unlike my college papers), Microsoft
	  Word hindered me more often than it managed to provide
	  assistance. Amazingly, I was far more productive writing
	  articles directly in XHTML using Emacs (the <em>best</em>
	  editor I've ever used<sup><a href="#emacs">4</a></sup>).</p>
	  <p>Aside from the obvious requirement to be able to
	  efficiently edit text I needed my word processor to help me
	  do two things: specify the structure of my document as I
	  write it and let me style it later. Surprisingly Microsoft
	  Word isn't very good for creating documents in this
	  manner. While it supports styling and structural markup, it
	  doesn't in any way encourage it. By default it's much easier
	  to mark a selection as bold than to emphasize it using
	  markup. XHTML, on the other hand, is different. I can only
	  specify structure. If I try to use old HTML styling tags, it
	  doesn't validate. This way I can focus on the content of my
	  document and its structure. I can style it with CSS later. I
	  can even provide different styles for my site, for printing,
	  and for other sites that might want to publish my
	  articles.</p>
	  <p>It is common wisdom among programmers that information
	  and the way it's presented should be separated. A well
	  defined boundary between markup and styling allows to easily
	  add other ways to present information. Additionally, it
	  greatly enhances the ability to change information
	  independently from its presentation. These are both very
	  desirable properties and they are <em>not</em> limited to
	  web pages. None of the mainstream word processors that I am
	  aware of promote this paradigm. If I want to write documents
	  this way I'm left with relatively few alternatives. XHTML
	  and CSS are one, but they're relatively new technologies
	  designed specifically for document distribution over HTTP.
	  There is no easy way to convert my XHTML document along with
	  appropriate CSS stylesheets to a single file I could send
	  someone over e-mail. LaTeX does better. Once I create a
	  LaTeX document I can easily convert it to any format I am
	  interested in, including XHTML and Microsoft Word
	  Document. I can compose documents the way I like and
	  distribute them to the world in any format that happens to
	  be fashionable at the time. As a bonus LaTeX has tags for
	  almost everything I may want to specify in my documents. And
	  if it doesn't, I can extend it with my own.</p>
	  <p>Modern office suites are already moving towards markup
	  and styling. It will take them many years to embrace this
	  paradigm completely and shed the legacy of styling
	  interleaved with the document - a very poor design for
	  obvious reasons. On the other hand, LaTeX is here today and
	  there is no reason for us to to wait for word processors to
	  catch up.</p>

	  <h3>Open Document Format</h3>
	  <p class="first">For the past couple of years there has been
	  a big debate sparked by the <a
	  href="http://www.odfalliance.org/">OpenDocument Format
	  Alliance</a>. Companies and governments decided they no
	  longer want to be restricted to using Microsoft Word to edit
	  and distribute their documents and came up with a radical
	  idea that their information should be stored in an open
	  format in order to allow competing word processors to have a
	  real chance to win market share. Of course OpenDocument
	  isn't here yet. Nobody can agree on the tags and Microsoft
	  doesn't want to let go of market domination it has achieved
	  by locking people into their format.</p>
	  <p>There is no reason for OpenDocument Format Alliance to
	  reinvent the wheel and there is no reason for us to wait
	  until they're done. LaTeX is already here. When you create
	  your next document, let it rise to the occasion. The format
	  is open and has a wide variety of standard tags. It is human
	  readable and can be modified in a multitude of editors from
	  Notepad, to Emacs, to visual editors like <a
	  href="http://www.lyx.org/">Lyx</a>. Additionally, LaTeX has
	  a wide pool of available importers and exporters - you can
	  import pretty much any document into LaTeX, modify it, and
	  export it back into any format you like (from Word to HTML
	  to PDF). LaTeX has everything an open, portable, extensible
	  format should have. The only thing missing is the hype.</p>

	  <h2><a id="part_4">What's next?</a></h2>
	  <p class="first">Word Processors are the least useful
	  components of modern office suits. An argument about
	  Microsoft Word vs. Word Perfect is a false dilemma as there
	  are better alternatives. Don't let LaTeX intimidate
	  you. Once you play around with it and take some time to
	  understand it, it becomes obvious that it's a very natural
	  design - another proof that most great software was designed
	  early in computer history. It may seem alien and dated but
	  behind the cover there is a very powerful way to compose and
	  distribute documents. Do a google search on LaTeX and you'll
	  find plenty of tools equipped to edit LaTeX documents (this
	  is somewhat like a multitude of HTML editors out
	  there). Alternatively, if you don't feel like learning LaTeX
	  tags, download <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">Lyx</a> - a
	  visual document processor that takes care of the details
	  behind the scenes.</p>

	    <p><sup><a id="bad-entries">1</a></sup>I am, of course,
	    referring to <a
	    href="http://www.iiisci.org/sci2005/website/default.asp">WMSCI
	    2005</a>, a conference that accepted a paper generated by
	    <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">SCIgen</a>, a

	    fits right in. I hope to write an article about it some
	    time in the future.</p>
