h1. This is the data for my blog

Everything is MIT licensed, do with it as you please. This project was
shamelessly forked from mojombo.github.com. I wanted a quick way to
publish my thoughts with very little effort, a minimalist design, and
readable typography, and mojombo.github.com does exactly that.
