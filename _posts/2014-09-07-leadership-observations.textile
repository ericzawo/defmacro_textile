There are already very good lists of startup lessons written by really talented, experienced people ("here":http://betashop.com/post/32913573235/90-things-ive-learned-from-founding-4-technology and "here":http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice). I'd like to add another one. I learned these lessons the hard way in the past four years. If you're starting a company, I hope you have an easier path.
