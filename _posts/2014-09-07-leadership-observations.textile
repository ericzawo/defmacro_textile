There are already very good lists of startup lessons written by really talented, experienced people ("here":http://betashop.com/post/32913573235/90-things-ive-learned-from-founding-4-technology and "here":http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice). I'd like to add another one. I learned these lessons the hard way in the past four years. If you're starting a company, I hope you have an easier path.

bq. "He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how."
-- _Friedrich Nietzsche_

# Regardless of success or failure, it's a matter of time until your passion for operational details and prestige subsides, an alternative life presents itself, and you start asking yourself "why?" It might happen when you lose or gain a loved one, or it might happen on your deathbed, but it *will* happen. The sooner you internalize it, the fuller your life will be.
# Your true north is the answer to this why -- a point in the emotional, intellectual, cultural, and empirical space you can use to calibrate your inner compass when it's in turmoil.
# The raw materials for your true north are your convictions and desires, forged in a crucible of competing emotions, ideas, people, and facts. It is one of the most difficult and rewarding processes in the human experience.
