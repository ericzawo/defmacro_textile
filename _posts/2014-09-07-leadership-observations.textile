There are already very good lists of startup lessons written by really talented, experienced people ("here":http://betashop.com/post/32913573235/90-things-ive-learned-from-founding-4-technology and "here":http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice). I'd like to add another one. I learned these lessons the hard way in the past four years. If you're starting a company, I hope you have an easier path.

h2. Purpose

bq. "He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how." - Friedrich
-- _Friedrich Nietzsche_

# Regardless of success or failure, it's a matter of time until your passion for operational details and prestige subsides, an alternative life presents itself, and you start asking yourself "why?" It might happen when you lose a loved one, or it might happen on your deathbed, but it *will* happen.
