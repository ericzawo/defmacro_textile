The best article I know of on building a magical product for a massive market is the one on "reaching product/market fit":http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/pmarcaarchive/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only by Marc Andreessen. It's an excellent piece of advice, but by its own admission, it opens way more questions than it answers. If you know what you're looking for, it can help immensely. If you don't, it leaves you profoundly stuck.

My startup is going through this process now. We've got things __nearly__ figured out, but at the same time we're not quite there, not quite over the line. This places me in a unique position to talk about this problem. I'm not a complete newbie so I can talk about it with some authority, but I also didn't have a major success yet, so I don't have the benefit of hindsight and years of pattern matching experience.

So, from the perspective of someone who's smack in the middle of trying to catch the wave, how __does__ one reach product/market fit?

h3. Market dynamics

Despite its terseness, Marc's post accomplishes something most business books do not -- it covers pretty much all the dynamics of how products and markets interact. Let's summarize them here:

# __The need__ (the market) arises first, as a result of some social or technological change.[^1^]
# Once the need arises, multiple products that attempt to satisfy it will quickly arise.
# The first product to actually satisfy the need wins. It doesn't matter how good it is. It doesn't matter what else it can or cannot do. It's only necessary for it to be good enough at satisfying the actual need.[^2^]
# The upper bound of success is determined solely by the size of the market.

These dynamics are so universal, they're basically natural laws. Startups that don't understand them might as well be leaping off a building without understanding gravity. And yet, countless startups screw this up. How does one __not__ screw it up? The recipe, I think, is to ask three simple questions: __why now?__, __how big?__, and __why us?__.

h3. Game of Thrones vs. Hunger Games

To illustrate this a little better, let's look at two products slightly outside of the startup world -- Game of Thrones, and Hunger Games (the screen versions, but you can also apply this to books). To a naive observer these franchises came out of nowhere. But if you look a little deeper, you'll see that the model I described here applies perfectly.

Both franchises came into being at roughly the same time. __Why now?__ Arguably for two reasons. The first is that mass market media has been on a trajectory towards more violence, more grit, and youger, more sexualized characters. The second reason is that movies like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter paved the way for mass market acceptance of fantasy worlds. Combine these two factors, and you see a need -- an extremely violent, sexualized, mass market fantasy world for adults. Neither franchise would have been possible ten years ago. Both franchises will be old news ten years from now. But __right now__, these products are seeing phenomenal traction because there is a need, and it must be filled.

__How big__ is this market? Very, very big. Lord of the Rings big. Harry Potter big. Escapism for adults big (the key insight here is that adults want a few hours of escape from their lives even more than children do). We don't even need to do back of the napkin math big.

__Which one__ will win? As far as franchises go, my money is on Game of Thrones. Why? Because it doesn't equivocate. It's unafraid of picking a unique direction to satisfy a need and taking it to its logical conclusion. Hunger Games, on the other hand, __does__ equivocate. It's dealing with children, so the creators are worried about stepping too far. It's on the big screen, so it isn't as free to take a stance as Game of Thrones is on HBO. The violence isn't as gritty, and the sex is largely missing. Even the teenagers who Hunger Games was designed for want Game of Thrones instead.[^3^] Hunger Games is good, but it isn't quite __good enough__ at satisfying the actual need. They tried to add bells and whistles like fancy costumes and CGI, but the market doesn't care. The market wants a fantasy world that's as violent and as sexualized as possible. It wants Game of Thrones.

That's all there is to it. Doing this type of analysis is half the battle. Unfortunately, being objective while applying it to your own startup without the benefit of hindsight turns out to be really, really hard.

^1^ Some products are so transformative, they themselves act as the necessary social or technological change to unlock a pent up need. But it's rare enough that I wouldn't count on it.
^2^ Depending on the market the second product might also do ok (but a lot worse). The third product almost certainly won't matter.
^3^ The market is so huge, that both franchies will probably do ok. There might even be enough space for a third one.
