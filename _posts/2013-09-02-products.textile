The best article I've ever read on the most important thing in a startup is the one on "product/market fit":http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/pmarcaarchive/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups-part-4-the-only by Marc Andreessen. By its own admission, Marc's article opens way more questions than it answers. It talks about something very important, but unless you already know what to do, the advice doesn't seem very actionable.

Another way to look at this problem is a phrase coined by Paul Graham -- "build something people want." Paul wrote a "number":http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html of "essays":http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html about it, but they seem to suffer from the same problem as Marc's post -- they open more questions than they answer.

Both pieces of advice are excellent (and arguably the best there is), but both seem like fingers pointed at the moon. They help immensely if you know what you're looking for, but they leave you profoundly stuck if you don't.

My startup is going through this very process right now. I feel like we've got things __nearly__ figured out, but at the same time we're not quite there, not quite over the line. This places me in a very unique position to talk about this problem. I'm not a complete newbie so I can talk about it with a bit of authority, but I'm also not over the line, so I don't have the benefit of hindsight and years of pattern matching experience to affect my judgement.

So, how __does__ one build something people want that reaches product/market fit, from the perspective of someone who's smack in the middle of trying to catch the wave?

h3. Market dynamics

Despite its terseness, Marc's product/market fit post accomplishes something most business books do not -- it covers pretty much all the dynamics of how products and markets interact. Let's summarize these dynamics here:

# Most of the time __the need__ (also known as the market) comes first, as a result of some social or technological change.[^1^]
# The product to satisfy the need will arise very quickly after the need arises. You can count on __that__.
# The first product to actually satisfy the need wins. It doesn't matter how good it is, as long as it's good enough.
# The upper bound of success is determined solely by the size of the market.

^1^ Some products are so transformative, they themselves act as the necessary social or technological change to unlock a pent up need. But it's rare enough that I wouldn't count on it.
