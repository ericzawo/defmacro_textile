[RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com) is a tribe (or, more accurately,
a [band](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society)). We spend a lot
of time together, and have a shared set of goals and values. We're
also small enough that decisions can be made by concensus, but big
enough that no one person could keep track of everything going
on. Under these circmustances, we evolved a simple and effective
decision making process.

Most decisions are made by concensus. The relevant people get
together, interrogate the issue for a while, and voluntarily arrive at
a unanimous decision. Most technical and many non-technical decisions
are made this way. However, there are circumstances where this process
breaks down.





Over the course of growing the team at RethinkDB I learned an enormous amount about how to manage people. Perhaps the most important lesson is when to fire someone.

h3. Push vs. pull people

Someone people do stuff of their own volition. It may not be the stuff you want. It may not be the quality you want. But they do it. They push stuff onto you.

h3. Coach vs. babyshit people

Some people can be coached. You have a conversation about how they're doing, and they change. Other people make having such conversations awkward and difficult, or welcome them but don't change at all.

h3. Versatility

Some people can perform a wide variety of work. Others start slacking (other on push vs pull or coachability, which means different things -- they don't want to do the job, or can't do the job)

h3. Consistency

Some people are consistent in their push and coach metrics on a given job. Others aren't.
