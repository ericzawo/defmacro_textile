"RethinkDB":http://www.rethinkdb.com is a tribe (or, more accurately, a "band":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society). We spend a lot of time together, and have a shared set of goals and values. We're also small enough that decisions can be made by concensus, but big enough that no one person could keep track of everything going on. Under these circmustances, we evolved a simple and effective decision making process.

h3. Concensus

The vast majority of decisions are made by concensus. The relevant people get together, interrogate the issue for a while, and voluntarily arrive at a unanimous decision. When a decision is reached, everyone goes off and does the work. Most technical and many non-technical decisions are made this way. This process is self-sustaining -- it works smoothly on its own, and requires very little management. However, there are circumstances where this process breaks down.

h3. Tie-breakers

Occassionally when matters of taste are involved, concesus cannot be reached. When discussions  don't converge to a unanimous decision, I (as a product lead) appoint a tie-breaker who makes the final decision. Typically, it's a person who has a really good taste at the relevant class of issues.

We currently have three official tie-breakers -- one for coding style, one for language design, and one for visual design. We also have many informal tie-breakers -- people who are masters of their craft that others trust to make good decisions and concede to their judgement in case of ties. Between concensus and tie-breakers, we can resolve close to 99% of all decisions.

h3. Course corrections

Occassionally, the team arrives at unanimous concesus and I feel the decision is wrong. Usually it means something about the underlying goals or values had to change to accomodate reality, but I failed to communicate it to the team. (One example of this is "being user-focused":http://www.defmacro.org/2013/04/03/issue-etiquette.html). Most of the time I can sit everyone down, explain my concerns, and have everyone re-evaluate the decision. In some cases, it might take some time for people to adjust, in which case I have to override their decision by authority.

Our company is small enough and everyone here is talanted enough that I can't use formal authority to enforce my will (nor would I want to). I have to use the political capital I've built up, which requires an enormous degree of bilateral trust. I have to trust people to do their jobs, and they have to trust me to accept decisions they disagree with. Cultivating this trust is a big part of what makes RethinkDB tick.

h3. Required qualities

The way we work is only possible because everyone on our team consistently displays the following qualities:

* *Passion matched by raw talent.* foo
* *Shared sense of taste.* foo
* *Emotional maturity.* foo

There is one more quality that doesn't necessarily follow from the process outlined above, but is so important it deserves a special mention:

* *Shipping quickly.* foo
