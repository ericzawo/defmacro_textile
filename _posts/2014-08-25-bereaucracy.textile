In hacker lore bereaucracy is synonymous with incompetence at best and malice at worst, an evil to be eradicated rather than a virtue to be cultivated. But I think hackers haven't got this quite right. It's easy to think of lethally effective bereaucracies like Napoleon's army, profoundly complacent ones like General Motors circa 2009, and all kinds in between.

Most hackers reject bereaucracy outright, which is a surprisingly atypical approach in the hacker culture. We usually consider and scrutinize every tool at our disposal. Why not bereaucracies too? We don't have the luxury of dismissing bereaucracy outright, nor of building an organization of complacency. So we do what we do best -- look at bereaucracy through the eyes of systems engineers.

Even at our scale, we've already introduced, evolved, dismantled, and reintroduced quite a few bereaucratic processes. We don't have nearly enough data to extrapolate to the scale and complexity of massive organizations like General Motors, but we did uncover interesting insights.
