In hacker lore bereaucracy is synonymous with incompetence at best and malice at worst, an evil to be eradicated rather than a virtue to be acquired. But I think hackers haven't got this quite right. It's easy to think of profoundly effective bereaucracies like Napoleon's army, lethally complacent ones like General Motors circa 2009, and all kinds in between.

If you think about this problem as a systems engineer, you'll find a goldmine of interesting questions:

- How and why does bereaucratic process come into existence?
- What distinguishes effective bereaucracies from complacent ones?
- How can we build effective bereuacracies from scratch?
- How do we keep effective bereuacracies from becoming complacent?
- How can we refactor complacent bereaucracies to be effective again?
