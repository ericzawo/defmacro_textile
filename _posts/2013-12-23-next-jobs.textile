I'd like to talk about the practice in the startup ecosystem of thinking about promising founders as the next @X@ (where @X@ is Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, or any other notoriously successful startup CEO). Investors think this way when evaluating deals, employees think this way when considering joining young startups, and startup founders think this way when they meet other founders.

That in itself isn't so bad. But what *is* bad is how this atmosphere encourages naive startup founders to fall into the deadly trap of thinking this way when evaluating themselves. I struggled with this line of thinking for three years, squirming in my own skin, exerting an immense amount of energy on a pointless and futile pursuit of trying to be someone I'm not. Now that I've worked through it all, almost every day I meet someone who is trapped in this same destructive pattern.

I don't know if I can overstate how dangerous this is for creativity. I wouldn't be surprised if this phenomenon cut the odds of startup success in half.
