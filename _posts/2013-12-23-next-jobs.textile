I'd like to talk about the practice in the startup ecosystem of thinking about promising founders as the next @X@ (where @X@ is Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, or any other notoriously successful startup CEO). Investors think this way when evaluating deals, employees think this way when considering joining young startups, and startup founders think this way when they meet other founders.

That in itself wouldn't be so bad. But what *is* bad is how this atmosphere encourages startup founders to think this way when evaluating themselves. I've seen countless people struggle with this line of thinking for years, and it hasn't been that long since I've struggled with it myself.

I think It's an extremely destructive pattern. I wouldn't be surprised if it cut the odds of startup success in half.
