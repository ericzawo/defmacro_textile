If you believe that "sales fix everything":http://www.defmacro.org/2013/07/23/startup-lessons.html, it follows that most startups fail because they don't end up shipping a great product in a growing market before they run out of money.[^1^] Assuming you've picked an explosive market, how do you go about building a great product?

Building great products is hard, but the problem is greatly exacerbated if you have no good mental model of how to go about it. Without a mental model you're left with looking at a never-ending stream of feature ideas and taking half-informed shots in the dark. Some people can pull this off because they start out with a phenomenal innate intuition for product design. But most people aren't blessed with such intuition on day one.

Over the past three years I learned a lot about building products. Here's the mental model I arrived at.

h2. Gamechangers, showstoppers, and distractions

Let's start with an example. Suppose you are building a new mobile phone. It has to be able to call people, or no one will buy it since it wouldn't be much of a phone. But the reverse isn't true -- having voice calls won't make anybody buy your phone because every other phone already does that. So for your mobile phone product, voice calls are a showstopper.

On the other hand, suppose you added a feature that allows projecting videos onto a surface. No other phone does that, so this feature could be a gamechanger that excites a lot of consumers. Alternatively, it's possible that most people won't care about it at all, in which case it's just a distraction.

This short example gives you three buckets to categorize any given feature:

* __A gamechanger.__ People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
* __A showstopper.__ People won't buy your product because you're missing this feature.
* __A distraction.__ This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

Empirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. Your job is to build an intuition about your space to be able to tell these categories apart as quickly as possible. That's still pretty subtle (is a built-in phone projector a gamechanger or a distraction?), but at least this structure gives you a plan of attack.

__^1^ There are also questions of distribution and economics, but the number of early stage startups that fail for these reasons pales in comparison to the number of startups that pick small markets or don't manage to deliver great products on time.__
