If you believe that "sales fix everything":http://www.defmacro.org/2013/07/23/startup-lessons.html, it follows that most startups fail because they don't end up shipping a great product in a growing market before they run out of money.[^1^] Assuming you've picked an explosive market[^2^], how do you go about building a great product?

Building great products is hard, but the difficulty is greatly exacerbated if you have no good mental model of how to go about it. Without a mental model you're left with looking at a never-ending stream of feature ideas and taking half-informed shots in the dark. Some people can pull this off because they start out with a phenomenal innate intuition for product design. But most people aren't blessed with this superpower on day one.

I started out with a terrible intuition (and didn't even know it). Over the past three years I've stared at our user metrics every day, creating a feedback loop to train my brain on what makes a good product. Eventually I got quite good at predicting an impact of any given feature, so I started thinking of a mental model that captures the essense of what I've learned. Here's what I arrived at.

h2. Gamechangers, showstoppers, and distractions

Let's start with an example. Suppose you are building a new mobile phone. It has to be able to call people, or no one will buy it since it wouldn't be much of a phone. But the reverse isn't true -- having voice calls won't make anybody buy your phone because every other phone already does that. So for your mobile phone product, voice calls are a showstopper.

On the other hand, suppose you added a feature that allows projecting videos onto a surface. No other phone does that, so this feature could be a gamechanger that excites a lot of consumers. Alternatively, it's possible that most people won't care about it at all, in which case it's just a distraction.

This short example gives you three buckets to categorize any given feature:

* __A gamechanger.__ People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
* __A showstopper.__ People won't buy your product because you're missing this feature.
* __A distraction.__ This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

Empirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. Your job is to build an intuition about your space to be able to tell these categories apart as quickly as possible. That's still pretty subtle (is a built-in phone projector a gamechanger or a distraction?), but at least this structure gives you a plan of attack.

h2. Resource allocation

If you had infinite time, you could ignore these categories and blindly iterate on the product until it finds enough resonance with the market. But your time is finite. The longer you take to find a great product, the more likely you are to run out of cash, squander morale, or miss the market moving under your feet. Thinking about product management in terms of the three categories is extremely useful because they allow you to treat product management as a resource allocation problem:

* If you put any effort into distractions, or you're wasting resources.
* If put more effort into showstoppers than the absolute minimum you can get away with, you're wasting resources.
* If you're doing more showstopper features than you absolutely need to, you're wasting resources
* If you're doing more than three gamechanging features, you're wasting resources.
* Pour as much of your creative energy into gamechanging features as possible.

__^1^ There are also questions of distribution and economics, but the number of early stage startups that fail for these reasons pales in comparison to the number of startups that pick small markets or don't manage to deliver great products on time.__
__^2^ I don't mean to imply that picking a good market is easier than building a great product. In fact, the opposite is true. It's far easier to get a handle on great product management, so I decided to tackle this subject first.__
