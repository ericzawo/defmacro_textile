If you believe that "sales fix everything":http://www.defmacro.org/2013/07/23/startup-lessons.html, it follows that most startups fail because they don't end up shipping a great product in a growing market before they run out of money.[^1^] Assuming you've picked an explosive market[^2^], how do you go about building a great product?

Building great products is hard, but the difficulty is greatly exacerbated if you have no good mental model on how to analyze products and features. Without a mental model you're left with looking at a never-ending stream of feature ideas and taking half-informed shots in the dark. Some people can pull this off because they start out with a phenomenal innate intuition for product design. But most people aren't blessed with this superpower on day one.

I started out with a terrible intuition (and didn't even know it). Over the past three years I've stared at our user metrics every day, creating a feedback loop to train my brain on what makes a good product. Eventually I got quite good at predicting an impact of any given feature, so I started thinking of a mental model that captures the essense of what I've learned. Here is what I arrived at.

h2. Gamechangers, showstoppers, and distractions

Let's start with an example. Suppose you are building a new mobile phone. It has to be able to call people, or no one will buy it since it wouldn't be much of a phone. But the reverse isn't true -- having voice calls won't make anybody buy your phone because every other phone already does that. So for your mobile phone product, voice calls are a showstopper.

On the other hand, suppose you added a feature that allows projecting videos onto a surface. No other phone does that, so this feature could be a gamechanger that excites a lot of consumers. Alternatively, it's possible that most people won't care about it at all, in which case it's just a distraction.

This short example gives you three buckets to categorize any given feature:

* __A gamechanger.__ People will want to buy your product because of this feature.
* __A showstopper.__ People won't buy your product because you're missing this feature.
* __A distraction.__ This feature will make no measurable impact on adoption.

Empirically, successful products have one to three gamechanging features, dozens of features that neutralize showstoppers, and very few features that are distractions. Your job is to build an intuition about your space to be able to tell these categories apart as quickly as possible. That's still pretty subtle (is a built-in phone projector a gamechanger or a distraction?), but at least this structure gives you a plan of attack.

h2. Resource allocation

If you had infinite time, you could ignore these categories and blindly iterate on the product until it finds enough resonance with the market. But your time is finite. The longer you take to find a great product, the more likely you are to run out of cash, squander morale, or miss the market moving under your feet. Thinking about product management in terms of the three categories is extremely valuable because it allows you to treat product management as a resource allocation problem.

If you put any effort into distractions, you're wasting resources. That much is obvious.

If you're doing more showstopper features than you absolutely need to, you're wasting resources. Lack of copy-pasting on the first iPhone might have been a showstopper for some people, but Apple correctly determined that enough consumers will still buy the phone. There was no need to delay.

If you put more effort into any given showstopper feature than the absolute minimum you can get away with, you're wasting resources. The first iPhone had pretty bad voice quality, but it was good enough -- most people were willing to live with it. It made calls, and it wasn't terrible. Improving the voice quality by another 10% would have made little measurable impact on adoption.

If you're doing more than three gamechanging features, you're wasting resources. Empirically, few distruptive products are good at a dozen things. Shipping gamechanging features is __hard__. Three is probably the most you can get away with, and even that is a stretch.

Finally, if you don't pour enough creative energy into any given gamechanging feature, you're wasting resources. If a gamechanging feature doesn't absolutely blow people away, it's not much of a gamechanger -- it's just a distraction. In this category you can't go half way.

You can get away with making some mistakes -- very few products absolutely nail this out of the gate. But most first time product managers break all of these rules all the time, probably because they're not aware of them. Break these rules at your own peril. The fewer mistakes you make relative to your competition, the better. Every mistake can be incredibly costly -- make too many and someone else will run circles around you.

h2. Craftsmanship

The most tricky part of building products is learning how to tell the difference between the categories and knowing when a given category is full. Is a built-in phone projector a gamechanger or a distraction? If it's a gamechanger, is it big enough to attract sufficient demand, or do you need another gamechanger? If you invented the technology to increase voice quality by 50%, does that become a gamechanger or is it still just a showstopping feature? How about 200%? How many showstoppers do you have to neutralize to build a compelling phone?

I have no idea what the answers are for the mobile phone market, but in my area, unstructured data, I can look at any given feature and tell which category it falls into quite easily. Sometimes I'm wrong, but that's ok. I just have to be wrong less often than my competitors.

The best way to build this intuition is to talk to a lot of people. Talk to potential users. What do they think? Talk to people who tried to build a product in your space and failed. What can you learn from their failure? Talk to competitors. How do they approach the problem? Talk to engineers in big companies. What can they tell you about the state of technology? Talk to other entrepreneurs in adjacent spaces, investors, journalists, grad students, professors, even the naysayers. The best way to get a sense of taste in a given space is to inject yourself into the industry and talk to as many people as you can.

h2. Users

The sooner you can learn about the history of the space, the state of the technology, the opinions of potential users, and the direction of your competition, the sooner you can form a coherent view of the space and develop a unique vision for your product. But be careful. It's easy to start taking advice from the wrong people.

Suppose you've decided to design your mobile phone in a form factor of a walkie talkie for construction workers, and you've determined that the best way to sell it is to construction managers top-down. If you talk to construction workers, they might be enamored by beautiful icons and an unusual color scheme. You might determine that the unique design of your phone is a gamechanger. But ultimately, it's the construction manager who's writing the check. For the construction manager, a beautiful design is nice, but it isn't a gamechanger. It doesn't help him run the business any better than he did before.

For complex business sales, you have to pay attention to all the parties and make sure all the stakeholders are satisfied. Are the construction workers strong influencers on the manager's decision? If so, spending time on a unique design might not be a bad idea. If not, you might be wasting your time. It's true even for consumer products. If you're designing a luxury phone and pricing it above every other phone on the market, you probably have to do something that convinces not only the buyer, but their spouse as well.

Make sure you know the difference between your users and people who are just commenting. A feature is only a gamechanger if the person signing the proverbial check recognizes it as one. Otherwise, it's a showstopper at best, but more likely it's just a distraction. A corollary of this is that you can't design a great product unless you know __exactly__ who your user is, what their problems are, and who are the people in their lives that help them make a buying decision. Your vision and intuition has to align with how the customers will perceive your product. Otherwise, you're just wasting time.

h2. Aggregates

A particularly thorny issue in product management is features that aren't sufficiently impressive on their own, but become gamechangers in aggregate.

h2. Product function

__^1^ There are also questions of distribution and economics, but the number of early stage startups that fail for these reasons pales in comparison to the number of startups that pick small markets or don't manage to deliver great products on time.__
__^2^ I don't mean to imply that picking a good market is easier than building a great product. In fact, the opposite is true. It's far easier to get a handle on great product management, so I decided to tackle this subject first.__
