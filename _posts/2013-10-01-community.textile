h2. Focus on your users

Your users don't see your product the way you do. Instead of product features they see a use case. Help them discover and understand your product through that lens. Speak their language. Go where they go. Focus on __their__ problems.



h2. Be direct

You will have to write. A lot. Product benefits, feature descriptions, technical documentation, release announcements, blog posts, social media comments, whitepapers, even e-mails to users.

Always be humble, concise, and direct. Don't try to sound impressive. State what the product does and doesn't do and let your users make their own judmenent. Short is better than long. Concrete is better than abstract. Avoid adverbs and adjectives -- use nouns and verbs. Review all copy with an eye for prefabricated phrases and marketing speak. Cut ruthlessly. Regularly read ""Politics and the English Language"":https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm and follow it religiously.

Always stay kind and polite. Treat everyone who took the time to use your product with reverence. Take all but the most crass questions seriously. Avoid talking about your competitors (but if you must, stick to facts).

Read the text out loud. If you can't imagine saying it to a friend or a colleague, rewrite it.
