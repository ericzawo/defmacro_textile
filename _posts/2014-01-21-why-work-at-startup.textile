Here is what the end of a typical startup interview looks like when you run into someone good:

bq. - Thank you for interviewing with us, we'll discuss with the team and get back to you by tonight. Do you have any questions for me?
- Yes, I have offers from Facebook and Google. Why should I work at your startup?

Ahh, the question from hell. Note to interviewees. This is a wonderful way to get back at the startup founders for seven hours of technical torture. By all means, use this opportunity! But next time you ask this question, think of this post and show _some_ compassion. To you, it's just a question. To them, it's an existential can of worms. "Does my startup have a good enough reason to exist? Am I a failure? Will I have to crawl back to mom and admit this whole Silicon Valley thing was a bad idea?" You get the idea.

But it _is_ a really good question. 

h2. Why not

You want to get rich quick. A median exit of a post series A startup is X, and at 1-2% of equity you'll get Y.

You want to learn to start a startup. There is no substitute for holding the reigns.

You want to learn from the founders. You'll likely be working with a guy or gal who's muddling their way through and are in no position to teach you anything.

You want to work on interesting problems. Sure machine learning, scale, blah blah. You'll be putting together yet another python server. You know it.

h2. Why, then?

To learn the most valuable skill you'll ever learn in your career and can't learn anywhere else. The difference between action and motion.
