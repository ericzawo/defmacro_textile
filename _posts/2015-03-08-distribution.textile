A startup is a living proof by induction. The medium for your proof is a large, fertile market. The base case is a product that a small subset of target customers love. The inductive step is superlinear distribution that allows the product to propagate through the ether of the market. 

There is an art and a science to "building great products":/2013/09/26/products.html. If you're perceptive and willing to work hard you can usually figure out the base case for almost any idea. Building something just one person will love isn't _that_ hard once you get the knack for it. And if your product satisfies one person, it will usually satisfy a dozen.

If you're lucky enough to have "picked a huge market":/2015/02/25/startup-ideas.html, your proof has two of the three necessary components for your startup to succeed. But they aren't sufficient, because empirically there is an enormous gap between having a great product in a promising market, and actually dominating that market. This gap is distribution.

So the question is how to go from a dozen happy users in a big market to a hundred million in just a few years. This is the inductive step, the engine of user acquisition. You put some amount of dollars in, and get an asymptotically larger amount of users (and dollars) out.
