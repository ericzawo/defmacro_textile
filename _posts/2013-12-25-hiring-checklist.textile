h2. The one unique attribute

Always make sure the candidate possesses *dramatically* impressive talent and passion in one concrete, unique area, *and* that this area is critical to the team's success. Ask yourself -- what would happen if the candidate worked on the product for a month without any oversight? The result may not be what you would have liked, but would you be proud of the quality?

h2. Common attributes

Lack of any one of these attributes obliterates the delicate balance necessary for a well-gelled, well-run team. Never settle for a candidate who doesn't have one of these attributes, no matter how talanted they are, or how understaffed you are.

# *Commitment.* A person who isn't excited about the company's mission will perform mediocre work despite their best efforts.
# *Humility.* An egotistical person won't accept criticism or responsibility for mistakes. They'll always attribute the team's success to themselves, and failure to everyone else.
# *Pragmatism.* Strongly opinionated people are wonderful, so long as they validate the merit of their opinions in terms of the success of their practical application to the company's goals.
# *Effectiveness* where rubber meets the road.
# *Openness.*

You should be able to tell if the candidate has these qualities by having a simple conversation with them. Where did they grow up? What do they want to accomplish? How do they know if their work is good? How do they handle disagreements? Asking a few simple questions and paying attention to the answers can go a long way.

h2. What not to do

Don't look for pedigree or experience. If the candidate is talanted and passionate, committed to your company, huble, pragmatic, effective, and open, it doesn't matter whether they went to Harvard and worked at Facebook, or went to a community college and worked at a company you've never heard of. On the other hand, if they lack at least one critical attribute, what does it matter where they  worked or went to school?

If a candidate doesn't quite possess a dramatic talent or one of the other attributes you're looking for, don't hire them! Don't come up with complex models or structures. If you start thinking about pairing a candidate with someone else to get good results, trying to redefine your company's objectives, or starting to consider compromisng on your values, default to a no.
