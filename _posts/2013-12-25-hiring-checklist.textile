Common attributes:

Lack of any one of these attributes obliterates the delicate balanace
necessary for a well-gelled, well-run team. Never settle for a
candidate who doesn't have one of these attributes, no matter how
talanted they are, or how understaffed you are.

- Commitment. A person who isn't excited about the company's mission
  will perform mediocre work despite their best efforts.

- Humility. An egotistical person won't accept criticism or
  responsibility for mistakes. They'll always attribute the team's
  success to themselves, and failure to everyone else.

- Pragmatism. Strongly opinionated people are wonderful, so long as
  they validate the merit of their opinions in terms of the success of
  their practical application to the company's goals.

- Effectiveness where rubber meets the road.

- Openness.

Unique attribute:

- Dramatic talent and passion in a concrete, unique area critical to
  the team's success.

Attributes not to look for:

Pedigree, experience
Don't come up with complex structures (pairing people, etc.)
