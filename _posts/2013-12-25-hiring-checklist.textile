h2. Common attributes

Lack of any one of these attributes obliterates the delicate balanace necessary for a well-gelled, well-run team. Never settle for a candidate who doesn't have one of these attributes, no matter how talanted they are, or how understaffed you are.

- __Commitment__. A person who isn't excited about the company's mission will perform mediocre work despite their best efforts.
- Humility. An egotistical person won't accept criticism or responsibility for mistakes. They'll always attribute the team's success to themselves, and failure to everyone else.
- Pragmatism. Strongly opinionated people are wonderful, so long as they validate the merit of their opinions in terms of the success of their practical application to the company's goals.
- Effectiveness where rubber meets the road.
- Openness.

h2. Unique attribute

- Dramatic talent and passion in a concrete, unique area critical to
  the team's success.
