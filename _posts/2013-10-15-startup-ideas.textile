You can think of a startup as a living proof by induction. The base case is a product that a small subset of target customers love. The inductive step is superlinear distribution. You put some amount of dollars in, and get an asymptotically larger amount of users (and dollars) out. The medium to support superlinear distribution is a large, fertile market.

There is "art and science to building great products":/2013/09/26/products.html, and if you're perceptive and willing to work hard you can usually figure out the base case for almost any idea. Building something just one person will love isn't _that_ hard once you get the knack for it. And if your product satisfies one person, it will usually satisfy a dozen. The world is a big place.

The question is how to go from a dozen happy users to a hundred million in just a few years. When it comes to the inductive step, you can't make every idea work by a sheer force of will or puritan work ethic, any more than you can hit the moon on a clear night with bow and arrow after years of diligent practice. Tenacity, determination, resourcefulness -- all are necessary but insufficient. If you want a moon shot, it's not enough to work hard. You have to work hard on the right problem.

So you need a method to tell promising problems from unpromising ones. One school of thought is that no such method could be devised, so you should just work on what interests you and see what sticks. I don't think so. I'm interested in Lisp compilers, and I know I could make one _someone_ will love. But it's obviously a bad idea. Why? What natural laws govern the arrival and propagation of products, ideas, and technologies? And how can you understand these laws and apply them to find and evaluate promising startups? 

h2. Four laws of change

To a reasonable observer the world seems curiously inefficient. Microwaves have atrocious UIs, politicians enact obviously shoddy policies, restaurant franchises throw out food instead of shipping it to poor families in third-world countries. From this vantage point it's not unreasonable to suspect collusion or conspiracy.

That is, until you actually try to change something. You max out your credit card developing a better microwave, only to discover that nobody is willing to buy it at the lowest price you can sell it for. You get elected into public office, only to discover you can't replace the shoddy policies because the alternative is worse. You start a non-profit trying to get leftover food to poor families, and find a plethora of structural reasons preventing you from fulfilling your mission.

From the perspective of new ventures, the market, it turns out, is _efficient_. If for one month you make a note every time you're dissatisfied with the world, and then work on a random entry from that list, chances are you will not be able to make a sustainable improvement. For the most part, everything is already precisely as good as it possibly could be at this moment in time. Ventures that try and make improvements are on average futile -- empirically most end in failure.

And yet, change does happen. Technology improves at a tremendous rate. Living under the most corrupt modern democracy is typically better than living under the best of European monarchies in the middle ages. The quality of life in third world countries has seen steady improvements decade after decade. If the market is efficient, how does the world improve?

I posit four natural laws of change:

# Implementing a given improvement requires energy expenditure inversely proportional to the magnitude of the improvement from the point of view of the target user.
# Organizations are able to expend energy in proportion to their size.
# Organizations are able to respond to new conditions with speed inversely proportional to their size.
# Latent energy will be expended as quickly as possible.

The first law says that if you ship a cell phone service that's one dollar per month cheaper than the alternative, it would take enormous energy to convince anyone to switch. If your service is $5/month cheaper, it will take a smaller, but still non-trivial amount of energy. And if your service costs one dollar per month, all other things being equal people will switch without any convincing -- there is enough ambient energy in the atmosphere for them to make the jump.

The second law says that.

The third law says that.

The fourth law says that.

h2. Game of Thrones vs. Hunger Games

To illustrate this a little better, let's look at two products slightly outside of the startup world -- Game of Thrones, and Hunger Games (the screen versions, but you can also apply this to books). To a naive observer these franchises came out of nowhere. But if you look a little deeper, you'll see that the model I described here applies perfectly.

Both franchises came into being at roughly the same time. __Why now?__ Arguably for two reasons. The first is that mass market media has been on a trajectory towards more violence, more grit, and youger, more sexualized characters. The second reason is that movies like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter paved the way for mass market acceptance of fantasy worlds. Combine these two factors, and you see a need -- an extremely violent, sexualized, mass market fantasy world for adults. Neither franchise would have been possible ten years ago. Both franchises will be old news ten years from now. But __right now__, these products are seeing phenomenal traction because there is a need, and it must be filled.

__How big__ is this market? Very, very big. Lord of the Rings big. Harry Potter big. Escapism for adults big (the key insight here is that adults want a few hours of escape from their lives even more than children do). We don't even need to do back of the napkin math big.

__Which one__ will win? As far as franchises go, my money is on Game of Thrones. Why? Because it doesn't equivocate. It's unafraid of picking a unique direction to satisfy a need and taking it to its logical conclusion. Hunger Games, on the other hand, __does__ equivocate. It's dealing with children, so the creators are worried about stepping too far. It's on the big screen, so it isn't as free to take a stance as Game of Thrones is on HBO. The violence isn't as gritty, and the sex is largely missing. Even the teenagers who Hunger Games was designed for want Game of Thrones instead. Hunger Games is good, but it isn't quite __good enough__ at satisfying the actual need. They tried to add bells and whistles like fancy costumes and CGI, but the market doesn't care. The market wants a fantasy world that's as violent and as sexualized as possible. It wants Game of Thrones.

h2. Recipes

Don't look at a hypergrowth company and try to compete. That's a bad idea.

- Divide and conquer. Amazon -> Gilt, Zappos, etc.
- Look at a hypergrowth company/technology. Determine what changed to make it possible. See if that change applies to other things. (AirBnB -> Lyft)
- Look at a hypergrowth company/technology. Assume it takes over the world. See what complementary company you can build. (Git -> GitHub, MongoDB -> MongoHQ)
- Look for moral values on the cusp of a big change. See if you can build a company around them (23andme, ashley madison [and most dating sites])
- Look at an expensive technology and see if you can make it assymptotically more accessible (sgi -> nvidia)
- Look at old, promising companies/technologies/ideas that never quite worked. See if something changes so you can make them work now. (Google, Oculus)
- Flipping the default (Snapchat)
