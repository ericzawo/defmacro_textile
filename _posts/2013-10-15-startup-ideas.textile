A startup is a living proof by induction. The base case is a product that a small subset of target customers love. The inductive step is superlinear distribution. You put some amount of dollars in, and get an asymptotically larger amount of dollars out. The medium to support superlinear distribution is a large, fertile market.

There is "art and science to building great products":/2013/09/26/products.html, but if you're perceptive and willing to work hard you can usually figure out the base case for almost any idea. Building something just one person will love isn't _that_ hard once you get the knack for it. And if your product satisfies one person, it will usually satisfy a dozen. The world is a big place.

The question is how to go from a dozen happy users to a hundred million in just a few years. You can't do that by a sheer force of will or puritan work ethic, any more than you can hit the moon on a clear night with bow and arrow after years of diligent practice. There are natural laws that govern arrival and propagation of products, ideas, and technologies.

h2. Efficient market hypothesis

Most first time entrepreneurs structure their companies to depend on a multitude of serendipitous events. They hope their startup idea will stick with customers, expect competitors to ship inferior products, and depend on journalists and PR to generate demand. While serendipitous events do happen, this is a suboptimal path. It makes much more sense to structure your company to depend on as few outside factors as possible, and be very disciplined about picking unlikely events that have to occur for you to succeed. The best way to build this discipline is to assume the markets are efficient, and work backwards.

If you take the efficient market hypothesis to its logical conclusion, you'll realize that startups are __very__ tricky business. The moment a new market need arises, multiple teams will quickly discover the problem and start working on it. Furthermore, you have to assume that a few of those teams will be at least as good as you are, and will work just as fast. Most importantly, the moment __just one__ of these teams delivers a baseline acceptable product that solves the underlying problem, the game is over. How can you plan to win in these conditions? The recipe, I think, is to ask three simple questions: __why now?__, __how big?__, and __why us?__.

h2. Game of Thrones vs. Hunger Games

To illustrate this a little better, let's look at two products slightly outside of the startup world -- Game of Thrones, and Hunger Games (the screen versions, but you can also apply this to books). To a naive observer these franchises came out of nowhere. But if you look a little deeper, you'll see that the model I described here applies perfectly.

Both franchises came into being at roughly the same time. __Why now?__ Arguably for two reasons. The first is that mass market media has been on a trajectory towards more violence, more grit, and youger, more sexualized characters. The second reason is that movies like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter paved the way for mass market acceptance of fantasy worlds. Combine these two factors, and you see a need -- an extremely violent, sexualized, mass market fantasy world for adults. Neither franchise would have been possible ten years ago. Both franchises will be old news ten years from now. But __right now__, these products are seeing phenomenal traction because there is a need, and it must be filled.

__How big__ is this market? Very, very big. Lord of the Rings big. Harry Potter big. Escapism for adults big (the key insight here is that adults want a few hours of escape from their lives even more than children do). We don't even need to do back of the napkin math big.

__Which one__ will win? As far as franchises go, my money is on Game of Thrones. Why? Because it doesn't equivocate. It's unafraid of picking a unique direction to satisfy a need and taking it to its logical conclusion. Hunger Games, on the other hand, __does__ equivocate. It's dealing with children, so the creators are worried about stepping too far. It's on the big screen, so it isn't as free to take a stance as Game of Thrones is on HBO. The violence isn't as gritty, and the sex is largely missing. Even the teenagers who Hunger Games was designed for want Game of Thrones instead. Hunger Games is good, but it isn't quite __good enough__ at satisfying the actual need. They tried to add bells and whistles like fancy costumes and CGI, but the market doesn't care. The market wants a fantasy world that's as violent and as sexualized as possible. It wants Game of Thrones.

h2. Recipes

Don't look at a hypergrowth company and try to compete. That's a bad idea.

- Divide and conquer. Amazon -> Gilt, Zappos, etc.
- Look at a hypergrowth company/technology. Determine what changed to make it possible. See if that change applies to other things. (AirBnB -> Lyft)
- Look at a hypergrowth company/technology. Assume it takes over the world. See what complementary company you can build. (Git -> GitHub, MongoDB -> MongoHQ)
- Look for moral values on the cusp of a big change. See if you can build a company around them (23andme, ashley madison [and most dating sites])
- Look at an expensive technology and see if you can make it assymptotically more accessible (sgi -> nvidia)
- Look at old, promising companies/technologies/ideas that never quite worked. See if something changes so you can make them work now. (Google, Oculus)
- Flipping the default (Snapchat)
