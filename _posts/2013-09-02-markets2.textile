There is a "relativity of wrong":http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm when picking startup ideas.

Most people stumble on an idea, think of everything they can do with it in a fairly depth-first way, and then start working on it. That's pretty bad. The outcome is usually a bad product in a bad market.

Fewer people stumble on an idea, then think of how to design a product in a "systematic way":http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html, and then start working on that. That's a little better, but the outcome is still pretty bad. Empirically a good product in a bad market doesn't do that much better than a bad product in a bad market.

Even fewer people stumble on an idea, then take the time to evaluate if it's worth working on. If it is, they jump in. If not, they rinse and repeat. That's better still, but not ideal. What if your default algorithm for generating ideas produces bad ideas? Then you're just picking the best idea from a bad set.

Finally, very few people have a systematic process both for generating ideas, and for evaluating them. That's spectacular.

It opens up two questions. What's a good way to generate startup ideas, and what's a good way to evaluate them? Suppose you came up with good answers to these questions. You're still not done. If you're on the internet, you can sell to anyone in the world, but so can anyone else. You're competing with __everyone__ in the world. So it's enough to just have good ideas. People can come and eat your lunch. So you have to think about that too.

To get a handle on this, you need a model of how markets work and how technology innovation happens. So let's start with that.

There are three basic models on how markets work.

The first is...
