When I first started RethinkDB I was absolutely terrible at designing _products_. I didn't need to be -- I just didn't know better. Here's a list of most important lessons I learned about product design.

h3. Differentiation vs neutralization

Learn it and live it. For feature X there are only two questions that matter -- will they buy *because* of X, will they *not* buy because of X?

h3. Products sell inspite of issues

They don't sell because there are no issues.

h3. Importance of school

Never build a product without a corresponding field. (http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/if-im-not-writer-then-im-nothing.html)

h3. Importance of packaging

Iambic pentameter can be packaged into a Shakespearean play, or into a hip hop song. Pick the right packaging for the time and the audience. Have the courage to stand for principles, but don't be afraid of fashion. Embrace it.
