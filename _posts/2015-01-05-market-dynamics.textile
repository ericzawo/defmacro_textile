When I started my company five years ago, I didn't know anything about how markets develop or what principles govern their ebb and flow. Eventually I went on to learn far more about the subject than I ever thought possible. It's five years later, but much of the information on market dynamics is still locked up in the minds of people who learned the ropes through trial and error. This post is a crash course I wish I had when I was getting started.

# All human advancement (in business, technology, art, sport, politics, and religion) happens in "clusters":http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/if-im-not-writer-then-im-nothing.html. Scientists tend to call them __fields__, artists tend to call them __schools of thought__, and business people tend to call __markets__.

#_ Personally fix bugs and ship features. You have to write code to remain an effective tiebreaker, but that's where your coding responsibilities end.
# Supervise the quality and volume of people's work. Software engineering isn't an assembly line. If you find yourself supervising too often, you haven't attracted the right people or given them the right incentives.
