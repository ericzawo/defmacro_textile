h2. Issue etiquette guidelines

h3. Acknowledge receipt

It isn't always possible to start working on an issue immediately, and
that's ok. But nothing is worse than submitting an issue and getting
no response from the team for days. A simple receipt acknowledgment
from a human goes a very long way to make the user happy.

Here's an example of a really good rceipt acknowledgement:

bq. Hi @xyz, thanks for letting us know about this bug. This is
@wmrowan's and @mlucy's domain, I'll ask one of them to look at
it. I'll get back to you in a day when we start looking at it.

It includes everything necessary to keep the user from wondering about
the state of the issue:

* Receipt acknowledgement
* Info of people responsible for the issue
* List of next steps
* An ETA for next point of communication

h3. Acknowledge beginning of work

Blah blah. Here's an example of a really good rceipt acknowledgement:

bq. Only one, but it's always the right one.  

Foo bar.
