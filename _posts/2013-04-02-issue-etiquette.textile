Issue etiquette is important. Here is a list of simple guidelines that can go a very long way to keep users happy:

h3. IE0. Acknowledge receipt

It isn't always possible to start working on an issue immediately, and that's ok. But nothing is worse than submitting an issue and getting no response from the team for days. A simple receipt acknowledgment from a human goes a very long way to make the user happy. Here is an example of a really good receipt acknowledgement:

bq. Hi @xyz, thanks for letting us know about this bug. This is @wmrowan's and @mlucy's domain, I'll ask one of them to take a look. I'll get back to you when we start looking at it -- we should be able to get to it in a day or two.

h3. IE1. Acknowledge beginning of work

Once you start working on the issue, give the user a quick note that you're looking into it. It's nice for the user to know when their issue is being worked on, and it's very useful to be able to talk to the person who's actually working on it.

bq. Hi @xyz, I'm looking into this issue. I'll get back to you when I have a little more info, should take an hour or so.

h3. IE2. Summarize the state of the issue

Once you've looked into the issue, give the user a summary of the state of affairs. Here's an example of a really good summary:

bq. Hi @xyz, I've started looking into this. It looks like the server is crashing because the random number generator is broken. The random number generator that we use uses the keyboard to generate entropy, but the RandomNoKeyboardException indicates that you seem to be running on a server with no active keyboard. I'm now working on switching the random number generator to the one that uses page fault count for entropy, which will alleviate this problem. It should take me about two days to implement and test this.

h3. IE3. Give periodic updates

Sometimes development takes longer than expected, and sometimes the ETA is too far into the future. In both cases the user will understandably get antsy without periodic feedback. It's usually extremely helpful to give a quick and informative update on the state of development.

bq. Hi @xyz. I've plugged in the new random number generator based on page fault count and it seems to be working well. The server passes all the tests which stress the generator pretty heavily. We still need to test what happens on a server without a keyboard. I'm handing this off to @coffeemug -- he says he should be able to test this in the next day. Unless we run into unexpected issues, we should be able to get the fix to you in the next two days.

h3. IE4. Make responsibility clear

In *IE3* @srh hands off the responsibility for the issue to @coffeemug. Until @coffeemug responds, the issue is still in @srh's court, and he's responsible for giving periodic updates and ping @coffeemug until @coffeemug responds to pick up responsibility. Here's an example message from @coffeemug that picks up responsibility and frees @srh from control of the issue:

bq. Hi @xyz, I'm on this. As @srh said, it should take me about a day to get this tested. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

h3. IE5. Notify about completion

Mention commit number and reviewers. Say what's been done. Say what tests were done to verify. Say when it'll be available and via which release.

h3. IE6. Notify about availability

Mention release number, download URL, thank everyone for their work.

Always answer the following questions:
1. Who's responsible for the issue
2. The latest understanding of exactly what's going on
3. What's already been done
4. What remains to be done
5. Is the issue is being worked on
6. Next steps
7. ETA on next steps

Our Process:
- Acknowledge receipt
- Tell them you're on it
- Give your diagnosis
- Give periodic updates
- Notify on compeletion
- Notify on availability

Make sure to:
- Give enough information
- Inform everyone if you slip
- Inform everyone if you're on track
- Use friendly tone
