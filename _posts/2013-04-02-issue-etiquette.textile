Issue etiquette is important. This list of simple Etiquette Guidelines (*EGs*) can go a very long way to keep users happy:

h3. EG0. Acknowledge receipt

It isn't always possible to start working on an issue immediately, and that's ok. But it's very frustrating to submit an issue and get no response from the team for days. Give a simple receipt acknowledgment to alleviate this frustration:

bq. @xyz, thanks for letting us know about this bug. This is @wmrowan's and @mlucy's domain, I'll ask one of them to take a look. I'll get back to you when we start looking at it -- we should be able to get to it in a day or two.

h3. EG1. Notify when you start work

Once you start working on the issue, give the user a quick note that you're looking into it. It's helpful for the user to know when you start working on their issue, and it's very useful to be able to talk to the person who's working on it directly:

bq. I'm looking into this issue. I'll get back to you when I have a little more info, should take an hour or so.

h3. EG2. Summarize the state of the issue

Once you've looked into the issue, give the user a summary of the state of affairs. Here's an example of a really good summary:

bq. I've started looking into this. It looks like the server is crashing because the random number generator is broken. The random number generator that we use uses the keyboard to generate entropy, but the RandomNoKeyboardException indicates that you seem to be running on a server with no active keyboard. I'm now working on switching the random number generator to the one that uses page fault count for entropy, which will alleviate this problem. It should take me about two days to implement and test this.

h3. EG3. Give periodic status updates

Sometimes development takes longer than expected, and sometimes the ETA is far enough into the future to make the user anxious. In both cases, it's immensely helpful to give periodic status updates every few days:

bq. I've plugged in the new random number generator based on page fault counts and it's working well. Here is what still needs to get done:
* The new random number generator breaks one of the unit tests. I need to fix it.
* After that, we need to test on a server without a keyboard.
I'm now working on the unit tests and will hand this issue to @coffeemug to do the server testing when I'm done. Unless we run into unexpected issues, we should be able to get the fix to you in the next two days. I'll keep you posted on our progress.

A good status update will include all of the following information:

# What's already been done
# What remains to be done and a plan on how to do it
# What you're working on next and its ETA
# A list of known roadblocks and a plan on how to solve them
# Overall ETA on closing the issue

Most people reading the update won't have all the context you do, so make sure you give enough information for everyone to understand what you mean. It's your responsibility to be comprehensible.

h3. EG3-a. Inform everyone if you slip

Foo

h3. EG3-b. Inform everyone if you're on track

Bar

h3. EG4. Make responsibility handoffs clear

Few things are more frustrating than ambiguity over who's responsible for fixing a problem. Keep this ambiguity to a minimum, and make sure to carefully hand off and pick up responsibility. Here's a good example of how to hand off responsibility:

bq. Ok, the new random number generator is finished, and all unit tests pass. I've talked to @coffeemug -- he'll test it on a server with no keyboard. This issue is now in his court.

And here's a good example of how to pick it up:

bq. I'm on this. As @wmrowan said, it should take me about a day to get this tested. I'll keep you posted on my progress.

h3. EG5. Notify on development completion

Mention commit number and reviewers. Say what's been done. Say what tests were done to verify. Say when it'll be available and via which release.

h3. EG6. Notify on fix availability

Mention release number, download URL, thank everyone for their work.

Always answer the following questions:
1. Who's responsible for the issue
2. The latest understanding of exactly what's going on
3. What's already been done
4. What remains to be done
5. Is the issue is being worked on
6. Next steps
7. ETA on next steps

Make sure to:
- Use friendly tone
