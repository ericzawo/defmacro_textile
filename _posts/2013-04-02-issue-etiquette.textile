h2. Issue etiquette guidelines

Here is a list of simple guidelines that can go a very long way to keep users happy:

h3. IE0. Acknowledge receipt

It isn't always possible to start working on an issue immediately, and that's ok. But nothing is worse than submitting an issue and getting no response from the team for days. A simple receipt acknowledgment from a human goes a very long way to make the user happy.

Here is an example of a really good receipt acknowledgement:

bq. Hi @xyz, thanks for letting us know about this bug. This is @wmrowan's and @mlucy's domain, I'll ask one of them to look. I'll get back to you when we start looking at it -- we should be able to get to it in a day or two.

In addition to the receipt acknowledgement, this message includes three key pieces of information:

* List of people responsible for the issue
* List of next steps
* An ETA for next point of communication

It's everything necessary to keep the user from wondering about the state of the issue.
 
h3. IE1. Acknowledge beginning of work

Once you start working on the issue, give the user a quick note that you're looking into it. It's nice for the user to know when their issue is being worked on, and it's very useful to be able to talk to the person who's actually working on it.

bq. Hi @xyz, I'm looking into this issue. I'll get back to you when I have a little more info, should take an hour or so.

This simple message contains a few key pieces of information:

* It comes from the person working on the issue
* It lets the user know work began, so they don't have to wonder
* It gives an ETA for next point of contact

Addtionally, from the developer's POV, it's great to know that someone's on an issue already, so this helps both the user and the development team.

h3. IE2. Summaryize the state of the union

Once you've looked into the issue, give the user a summary of the state of affairs with the issue. Here's an example of a really good summary:

h3. IE3. Give periodic updates

What's been done. What remains to be done and who's on it. How long it will take. What and who's blocking. When the next point of contact is.

h3. IE4. Notify about completion

Mention commit number and reviewers. Say what's been done. Say what tests were done to verify. Say when it'll be available and via which release.

h3. IE5. Notify about availability

Mention release number, download URL, thank everyone for their work.

h3. IE6. Summaryize the state of the union

Foo bar.

h3. IE7. Summaryize the state of the union

Foo bar.

h3. IE8. Summaryize the state of the union

Foo bar.
