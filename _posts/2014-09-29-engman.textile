Here is what you do.

h2. Your primary responsibilities include:
<br />

# Provide administrative support. Appraise, assign, and schedule bug tracker issues, coordinate releases, and make sure the bureaucratic machine, however small, keeps on ticking.
# Be the information hub. Left to their own devices, engineers don't communicate enough. Know what everyone is working on at any given time, and help connect the dots that wouldn't otherwise get connected.
# Be a tiebreaker when the development team can't reach consensus on shared issues.
# Fire underperformers.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Your primary responsibilities do not include:<br /><br /></h2>

#_ If you have to give away more than 15% of the company at any given fundraising round, your company didn't germinate correctly. It's salvageable but not ideal.
# Foo


<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Culture building<br /><br /></h2>

#_ The best products don't get built in a vacuum. They win because they reach the top of a field over all other products designed to fill the same niche. Find your field and be the best. If there is no field, something's wrong.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Disagreement resolution<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product management.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Conflict resolution<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Product comes first. If people love your product, the tiniest announcements will get attention. If people don't love your product, no amount of marketing effort will help.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Emotions<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Sales fix everything. You can screw up everything else and get through it if your product sells well.
