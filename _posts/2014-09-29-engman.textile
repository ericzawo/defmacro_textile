Here is what you do.

h2. Your primary responsibilities include:
<br />

# Attract, nurture, coach, and retain talent. Talk to engineers to tease out bubbling concerns, then fix them if you can. Fire bullies and underperformers.
# Enforce behavioral standards if people mistreat each other.
# Be the tiebreaker when the development team can't reach consensus.
# Communicate to every engineer the next most important issue to work on.
# Be the information hub. Know what every engineer is working on, and help connect the dots that wouldn't otherwise get connected.
# Provide administrative support. Appraise, assign, and schedule bug tracker issues, coordinate releases, and make sure the bureaucratic machine keeps ticking.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Your primary responsibilities do not include:<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Personally fixing bugs and shipping features. You have to write code to remain an effective tiebreaker, but that's where your coding responsibilities end.
# Supervising the quality or volume of people's work. Software engineering isn't an assembly line. If you find yourself supervising too often, you haven't attracted the right people or given them the right incentives.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Emotions, people, and culture<br /><br /></h2>

#_ If you feel something's wrong, you're probably right. Don't let anyone bully you into ignoring your feelings.
# If find yourself blaming someone you're probably wrong. Nobody wakes and tries to do a bad job. 95% of the time you can resolve your feelings by just talking to people.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Disagreement resolution<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product management.

#_ Product comes first. If people love your product, the tiniest announcements will get attention. If people don't love your product, no amount of marketing effort will help.
