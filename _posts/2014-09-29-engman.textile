Here is what you do.

h2. Your primary responsibilities include:
<br />

# Attract, nurture, coach, and retain talent. Talk to engineers to tease out bubbling concerns, then fix them if you can. Fire bullies and underperformers.
# Enforce behavioral standards when people mistreat each other.
# Communicate to every engineer the next most important issue to work on.
# Be the tiebreaker when the development team can't reach consensus.
# Be the information hub. Know what every engineer is working on, and help connect the dots that wouldn't otherwise get connected.
# Provide administrative support. Appraise, assign, and schedule bug tracker issues, coordinate releases, and make sure the bureaucratic machine keeps ticking.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Your primary responsibilities do not include:<br /><br /></h2>

#_ If you have to give away more than 15% of the company at any given fundraising round, your company didn't germinate correctly. It's salvageable but not ideal.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Culture building<br /><br /></h2>

#_ The best products don't get built in a vacuum. They win because they reach the top of a field over all other products designed to fill the same niche. Find your field and be the best. If there is no field, something's wrong.

#_ Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product management.

<h2 style="margin-left: -8px;"><br />Conflict resolution<br /><br /></h2>

#_ Product comes first. If people love your product, the tiniest announcements will get attention. If people don't love your product, no amount of marketing effort will help.
