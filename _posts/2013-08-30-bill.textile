Today is Bill Rowan's last day at RethinkDB. Bill has done some really amazing work here, including the recently completed Javascript and Python drivers. He decided to move on to work on something totally different (but equally cool). We'll miss him dearly, but I couldn't let him go without doing a bit of a retrospective on the things he accomplished here (using Bill's very own code, of course!)

First, I imported @git log@ data into RethinkDB using Bill's Python driver. (If you'd like to follow along Bill's adventure, see the code "here":https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/6417983) I then switched to the data explorer and Javascript (which is also Bill's doing) and focused on the hero of the occassion himself:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits').filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'}).count()
// 942
{% endhighlight %}

During his tenure here, Bill pushed 942 commits. Cool! Let's see what his very first commit was:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits').filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .orderBy('date').nth(0)
// {
//   "date": Fri Jun 17 2011 22:22:51 GMT+00:00 ,
//   "email": bill@rethinkdb.com,
//   "id":  "2da08b172d83ac5edea179689f32659d94ee2854" ,
//   "subject":  "fixed a bug in the memcached protocol implementation."
// }
{% endhighlight %}

Ah, that was back when Bill was an intern in 2011. He was still working on a memcached front-end back then, which we later scrapped in favor of ReQL and Bill's new drivers. I then wondered what his last commit was:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits').filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .orderBy(r.desc('date')).nth(0)
// {
//   "date": Thu Aug 29 2013 22:15:34 GMT+00:00 ,
//   "email": bill@rethinkdb.com,
//   "id":  "d5453cb99908160a33d174bd4bc546b56c644602" ,
//   "subject":  "Merge branch 'python_3' into next"
// }
{% endhighlight %}

Just yesterday Bill merged Python 3 support into the very Python driver I used to import this data. Looks like he worked till the very end, though he slacked off on his last day! Hmm, let's see how productive Bill was over the years:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits').filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .groupedMapReduce(r.row('date').year(),
                   function() {return 1;},
                   function(x, y) { return x.add(y); })
// [
//   { "group": 2011, "reduction": 74 },
//   { "group": 2012, "reduction": 357 },
//   { "group": 2013, "reduction": 511 }
// ]
{% endhighlight %}

Makes sense! Bill was an intern at RethinkDB for a small part of 2011. He then went back to school to complete his masters, and came back in 2012. His productivity really picked up in 2013, when he made 511 commits. Let's look at some of the bugs Bill fixed in RethinkDB:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits')
 .filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .filter(r.row('subject').match('fixes')).count()
// 145

r.table('commits')
 .filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .filter(r.row('subject').match('fixes')).sample(5)('subject')
// [
//   "fixes infinite loop issue introduced by previous",
//   "Merge branch 'next' into sprint_3_driver_fixes",
//   "funcall tests and fixes",
//   "fixes #527 automagically convert floats to integers",
//   "fixes orderby for python"
// ]
{% endhighlight %}

What about some features he added?

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits')
 .filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .filter(r.row('subject').match('adds')).count()
// 127

r.table('commits')
 .filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'})
 .filter(r.row('subject').match('adds')).sample(5)('subject')
// [
//   "adds variatic get all to JS driver",
//   "js client, adds append #1035",
//   "js client adds getter for last connection",
//   "adds return false to each to stop iteration",
//   "adds test for #992"
// ]
{% endhighlight %}

Lots of driver work! Let's look at one last random commit that Bill will be remembered by:

{% highlight javascript %}
r.table('commits').filter({email: 'bill@rethinkdb.com'}).sample(1)
// [
//   {
//     "date": Fri May 31 2013 21:17:52 GMT+00:00 ,
//     "email": bill@rethinkdb.com, Â»
//     "id":  "81f46036345ea047b2e23aa968cfc94bd8691644" ,
//     "subject":  "Merge branch 'next' into 443_onFinished_callback"
//   }
// ]
{% endhighlight %}

And... it's about the @onFinished_callback@ function in the Node.js implementation of the Javascript driver Bill loved to hate so much!
