Over the course of building RethinkDB we made many mistakes in structuring the company that need not be repeated. We simply didn't have the experience to know better. In this post, I will maintain a list of the most important lessons I learned about structuring startups.

h3. Get to significant growth with founding team

It's better that way. Depend on nobody but the founding team.

h3. Split shares between founding members evenly

Anything else just isn't worth it.

h3. But commit to a benevolent dictator

The buck has to stop somewhere and everyone needs to accept that emotionally from day one.

h3. Structure financing properly

If you have to give away more than 10% of the company or any significant control in any given financing round, you're doing it wrong.
