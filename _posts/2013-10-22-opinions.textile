bq. Iâ€™m convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.
-- Kurt Vonnegut

All engineers I know who are worth their salt have very strong opinions on a wide range of subjects.

* Strong typing works out better than weak typing, so we should use Java instead of Python
* Weak typing allows for quick iteration so we should use Python instead of Java
* Deadlines are necessary to produce successful software products
* Software timelines are unpredictable so we should do away with deadlines
* We have to refactor this component to make the product fast enough to be usable by customers
* Customers don't care about speed in this case, so refactoring is a waste of time

That's good. You must have strong opinions to decide between hundreds of available technologies, make progress in heated technical debates, and make decisions quickly when time is a factor. But there is another aspect to the software development equation. Strong opinions are necessary but not sufficient. You have to be "opinionated and right":http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&node=239365011, at least most of the time.
