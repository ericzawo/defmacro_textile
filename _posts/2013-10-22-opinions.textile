bq. Iâ€™m convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.
-- Kurt Vonnegut

Everyone I know in the startup world who is worth their salt has strong opinions on a wide range of subjects.

Deadlines are necessary to produce successful software products. Software timelines are unpredictable so do away with deadlines. Raise as little money as possible to get you to the next milestone. The best way to build a company is to raise as much money as you can. PaaS is the future because there is no money in support and licensing. PaaS has terrible economics and it's best to charge for support and licensing. The list goes on.

Strong opinions are necessary. You must have strong opinions to decide between hundreds of available technologies, make progress in heated product debates, and make business decisions quickly when time is a factor. But there is another aspect to the company building equation. But strong opinions are also insufficient. You have to be opinionated and "right":http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&node=239365011, at least most of the time.

In the course of my work I find myself having strong opinions on people management, fundraising, market dynamics, product management, marketing, sales, engineering, even personal psychology. I try to be direct about it to avoid wasting people's time. "I have strong opinions on X and I disagree with our direction." But whenever I find myself having a strong opinion, I also try to ask myself three questions:

* How did I come to form this opinion?
* What criteria am I using to gauge whether my opinion is correct?
* What evidence would I need to see to convince me I'm wrong?
