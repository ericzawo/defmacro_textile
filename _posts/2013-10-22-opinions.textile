bq. Iâ€™m convinced that no one can amount to a damn in the arts if he becomes sweetly reasonable, seeing all sides of a picture, forgiving all sins.
-- Kurt Vonnegut

Everyone I know in the startup world who is worth their salt has strong opinions on a wide range of subjects.

* Deadlines are necessary to produce successful software products
* Software timelines are unpredictable so we do away with deadlines
* Raise as little money as possible to get you to the next milestone
* The best way to build a company is to raise as much money as you can
* We're building a PaaS because there is no money in support and licensing
* PaaS has terrible economics so we charge for support and licensing instead
* ...

That's good. You must have strong opinions to decide between hundreds of available technologies, make progress in heated product debates, and make business decisions quickly when time is a factor. But there is another aspect to the company building equation. Strong opinions are necessary but not sufficient. You have to be opinionated and "right":http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&node=239365011, at least most of the time.

In the course of my work I find myself having strong opinions on people management, fundraising, market dynamics, product management, marketing, sales, engineering, even personal psychology. I try to be direct about it to avoid wasting people's time. "I have strong opinions on X and I disagree with our direction." But whenever I find myself having a strong opinion, I also try to ask myself three questions:

* How did I come to form this opinion?
* What criteria am I using to gauge whether my opinion is correct?
* What evidence would I need to see to convince me I'm wrong?
