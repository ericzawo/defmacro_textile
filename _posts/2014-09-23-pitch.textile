"This sounds really interesting. Let's circle back in a few days, we'd love to follow your progress."

We heard this over, and over, and over again from investors when we first started raising capital for our company. After weeks of fundraising and not getting any checks we went back to advisors and asked for feedback on our pitch. They listened carefully, and mostly said the same thing. "You've got to tell a compelling story." We thought we _were_ telling a compelling story. It turned out we weren't.

So I read all I could on pitching and story telling. I read "Save the cat":http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009, and "The Hero with a Thousand Faces":http://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936, and Dan Harmon's "notes on story structure":http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit, and Peter Theil's "startup notes":http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup, and Guy Kawasaki's "pitch deck advice":http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/how-to-create-a-pitch-deck-for-investors/, and Pixar's "rules of storytelling":https://mastersreview.com/tips-pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/. I read, watched, and listened to a myriad of resources. I even studied Ali G's parody of an "investor pitch":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48TR0vUPQCs. Hey, it doesn't hurt to learn what _not_ to do.

Then we tried again.

This time it worked. Eventually we went on to raise over $12M in funding, so there is some evidence we did _something_ right. Here are the lessons we learned and the template we settled on. As always, it's one man's opinion. Don't send angry e-mails if you use this structure and tank your fundraising round (or if you're an investor and you start getting terrible pitches with this structure).
