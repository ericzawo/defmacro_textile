"This sounds really interesting. Let's circle back in a few days, we'd love to follow your progress."

We heard this over, and over, and over again from investors when we first started raising capital for our company. After weeks of fundraising and not getting any checks we went back to advisors and asked for feedback on our pitch. They listened carefully, and mostly said the same thing. "You've got to tell a compelling story." We thought we _were_ telling a compelling story. In retrospect, I'm surprised our early audiences managed to keep themselves from cringing.

So I read all I could on pitching and story telling. I read "Save the cat":http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009, and "The Hero with a Thousand Faces":http://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936, and Dan Harmon's "notes on story structure":http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit, and Peter Theil's "startup notes":http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup, and Guy Kawasaki's "pitch deck advice":http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/how-to-create-a-pitch-deck-for-investors/, and Pixar's "rules of storytelling":https://mastersreview.com/tips-pixars-22-rules-of-storytelling/. I read, watched, and listened to a myriad of resources. I even studied Ali G's parody of an "investor pitch":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48TR0vUPQCs. Hey, it doesn't hurt to learn what _not_ to do.

Then we tried again.

This time it worked. Eventually we went on to raise over $12M in funding, so there is some evidence we did _something_ right. Here are the lessons we learned and the template we settled on. As always, it's one man's opinion. Don't send angry e-mails if you use this structure and tank your fundraising round (or if you're an investor and you start getting terrible pitches with this structure).

h2. Digression: don't take pitching advice from investors

A great pitch is about convincing and exciting people, so you can't craft it in a vacuum. You'll be presenting to a lot of people, and incorporating their feedback. To do that well, you have to separate good feedback from bad feedback, which brings us to a rather important sociological truth: humans are great at noticing problems but terrible at proposing workable solutions. Just look at global warming, ObamaCare, or building good UIs. "Why don't you do the obviously correct thing, instead of the obviously wrong thing?" Right. If only the world were that simple.

Good user experience designers have known for years that customers will get confused by bad design within seconds, but then offer suggestions that make a bad problem worse. Designers listen to feedback to notice problems, but largely ignore suggestions on how to fix them. Figuring out how to solve problems is the designer's job.

Investors are the customers for your pitch. They usually know a good pitch when they see one, and they definitely know a bad pitch (boy are they familiar with bad pitches), but they have no idea how to take a bad pitch and convert it to a good one. That's up to you.

Pay close attention to body language and facial expressions. Notice when people frown (they don't believe something), or zone out (you've lost them), or lean in at the edge of their seat (finally, you got something right!) Take careful notes, fix the bad parts, and double down on the good parts. But be very careful about taking specific advice on how to actually improve the pitch. Incorporating suggestions verbatum will usually make a bad pitch worse.

h2. Digression: all stories are the same

For all the infinite variety of storytelling, the crux of every story ever told is exactly the same. To quote Pixar's rules of storytelling:

bq. Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.

A good story is about change. The knights of the round table were hanging out in King Arthur's castle, doing whatever it is that the knights of the round table do. One day a monster appeared. Because of that the knights went out and did their knight thing. Until finally, they defeated the monster, having learned a lot in the process and transforming the organizational bereaucracy of the King's castle to deal with appearance of monsters more swiftly and cost effectively in the future.

(If you're a high art aficionado, I know there are stories that push the boundary of the medium and don't follow this structure. I'm ignoring those, because presumably your goal is to raise capital for your company, not to win a Nobel Prize in literature.)

The "Pearl Poet":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Poet knew what he was doing when he wrote about "Sir Gawan":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight. You can do far worse then follow his lead when structuring your investor pitch. So enough with the digressions. Let's get started.

h2. Title slide

When you first walk into the room to present your company, investors are suspended in a state of uncertainty. They know nothing about you or your business. Perhaps you're building kitty mp3 players. Or perhaps you've invented a new triangular marketing scheme. They don't know.

Fortunately their uncertainty is your canvas. Because they have no information, you get to define reality for them, right there, in the first thirty seconds. Before you jump into your story you need to give people _some_ anchor to hold on to, a reference point to orient themselves. This reference point is the name of your company and a single terse sentence explaining what you do. Put that on the intro slide in big letters.

"Hi, I'm so and so. I'm the founder of Kitty MP3. We make mp3 players shaped like kittys for teenage girls."

What you've just done in a mere few seconds is collapse a universe of possibilities into a single, tangible reality in people's minds. It's an enormous amount of information. They know roughly who you are -- you're so and so. Your company is called Kitty MP3. You don't in fact sell triangular marketing schemes -- you sell mp3 players shaped like kittys. And your target market is teenage girls.

Once you've given people a reference point, they start wondering. Why is so and so, a budding entrepreneur, decided it's a good idea to dedicate years of his life to building a kitty mp3 player company? It's time to tell your story!
