"This sounds really interesting. Let's circle back in a few days, we'd love to follow your progress."

We heard this over, and over, and over again from investors when we first started raising money for our company. After weeks of fundraising and not getting any checks we went back to advisors and asked for feedback on our pitch. They listened carefully, and mostly said the same thing. "You've got to tell a compelling story." We thought we *were* doing that. It turned out we weren't.

So I read all I could find on story telling. I read "Save the cat":http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009 and "The Hero with a Thousand Faces":http://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936 and Dan Harmon's "notes on story structure":http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit and Peter Theil's "startup notes":http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup and Guy Kawasaki's "pitch deck advice":http://www.marsdd.com/mars-library/how-to-create-a-pitch-deck-for-investors/, and a myriad of other resources.

And then we tried again.
