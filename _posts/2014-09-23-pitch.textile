One of the earliest lesson I learned in Silicon Valley is that a great story is the first prerequisite to starting a startup. Even during the initial stages of a startup you have to talk to people -- potential users, advisors, investors, industry experts, early employees, and eventually journalists. The first question people ask is "what does your startup do?" So communicating what you do is the first problem you have to solve.

A good story gives you tremendous descriptive power to explain what you do to different parties in a consistent way. But more importantly a good story is prescriptive -- it informs decisions and forces you to make disciplined choices. If you're about to make a decision that doesn't fit your story, you have to explicitly choose whether to reevaluate the decision or to refine your story. Early stage startups get pulled in a thousand different directions. They're much more likely to get killed by compromises than by committing to a wrong path. A good story keeps you honest, prevents you from trying to please everybody, and gives you the mental clarity to follow through on a concrete direction.

Since a good story is so important both for making decisions and explaining them, startups based on ideas that don't lend themselves to good stories tend to fail. I found that the inverse is also true -- studying storytelling is a surprisingly fruitful way to understand and improve your startup ideas.

h2. Story structure

Dramaturgy teaches us that the structure of most stories is surprisingly similar. To quote Pixar's rules of storytelling:

bq. Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___.

So a good story is about change, about the __"One day"__. The knights of the round table were hanging out in King Arthur's castle. One day a monster appeared. Because of that the knights went out to fight the monster. They overcame many challenges, until finally they defeated the monster and transformed the King's castle to deal with appearance of monsters more swiftly.

The structure of a good startup story is exactly the same. The world used to be in an equillibrium. Then something changed -- a series of trends to threaten that equillibrium. Because of that you're starting your company, doing X. Because of X, Y will happen. And Z. And W. Until finally the world will settle into a different, better and more efficient equillibrium.

You can take almost any successful startup and tell its story this way. People used to send money to each other by physically walking to Western Union branches. Then enough people got on the internet. Because of that, Max Levchin and Peter Thiel started PayPal, which dramatically reduced the friction to sending money. Because of that everyone switched. Until finally PayPal became an effective monopoly.

h2. Why this works

Most new founders don't talk about their startup this way. The mainstream impression is that startups succeed without any precipitating factor. On the surface it seems like startups just work very hard, get lucky, and invent dramatically better technology out of thin air. So when new founders explain their startups they jump straight to what they plan to do:

bq. We'll let people order takeout food online without having to call the restaurants.

Compare that to explaining the company through a story:

bq. People have to call restaurants to order takeout. But recently, a critical mass of people got comfortable with smart phones. Because of that, we're starting a food delivery company that will let people order food on their phones in a click of a button. That will give people a much more convenient experience. Because of that, people will order food together, which will give us network effects. Because of that, we can grow very quickly. Until finally we can own the food delivery market.

Explaining your company via a story works incredibly well on a surprising number of levels. It triggers the prehistoric circuits in our minds that resonate with narratives. Empirically, stories work better than statements if you're trying to get people's attention. So talking about your startup this way will resonate much better when you're trying to convince an audience to buy into your vision.

A good story make attracting and keeping talent is easier. If you have a clear story, it's easier to captivate potential employees, who in turn can captivate their spouses and join your company. Once they've joined, every employee has the tools to talk about why they're working for your company in the exactly the same way, which creates a unique bond and a sense of comraderie.

It makes PR efforts go much more smoothly. Journalists look for stories, and it's much easier for them to write about you if your company is designed to embody a story from the day of inception.

A good genesis story keeps you honest and makes things simple. Bad companies tell different stories to their users, investors, employees, and journalists, and work very hard to reconcile all these stories so they don't contradict each other. Good companies tell exactly the same story to everyone. Having a good coherent story early makes communication dramatically simpler and makes your life much easier.

An added benefit of narrative structure is that it forces you to commit to a hypothesis about the world. You can't just state what you're doing outright -- you have to pick a precipitating trend. In turn, that forces you to face the economic reality that when conditions make it possible for a market to arise, it will arise very quickly with or without you. This saves you from a huge class of rookie mistakes rooted in the assumption of individual exceptionalism, which is usually blatently incorrect. You now have to build a business by making a unique argument about the world and proving it correct, which models reality much closer than believing you're the smartest (or luckiest) entrepreneur on the planet.

Finally, a good story makes pitching your startup to investors dramatically easier. It decouples the underlying hypothesis from your product and company. To fund you, investors now have to believe two things -- that the hypothesis you've identified is correct and valuable, and that you're the one to take advantage of it. On the surface it appears worse than just stating what you do because now investors have to believe two things instead of one. But in reality, they think of your company and the market separately anyway, and it's much easier to convince people of two small but clear ideas than one large and obscure one.

h2. Borrow from The Economist

There is one major difference between telling a story about Sir Gawan and pitching your startup to investors. Literary plots are explicated through characters and their actions. Startup stories are explicated through an inductive argument. Your base case is the actions of a real person or organization. Your induction step is strongly cited statistics.

Your fourteen year old sister Mary spends four hours a day using her non-kitty mp3 player -- half an hour on her way to school, and half an hour on her way back home. Then another three hours while she does her homework. There are upteen million girls like Mary in the U.S., and according to these three very credible sources, between 70-75% of them exhibit the same behavior.

It takes a bit of practice to learn how to tell stories like that, and the best way to pick up the lingo and structure quickly is to read a couple of issues of The Economist. The analysis slides in your deck should resemble The Economist articles. There are a few very good reasons why you want to model these types of arguments after this venerable publication. The Economist correspondents are strikingly good at telling these types of stories. They tell great stories by alternating between individual cases and statistics. They make the audience feel smart by teaching them something new, and they're good at making strong arguments without triggering people's baloney detectors. Incidentally, this is exactly the vibe you want to go for when pitching your startup.

More importantly, The Economist specifically targets affluent business audiences. The overwhelming majority of the investors you'll end pitching read it, and The Economist correspondents are used to business lingo. If you explicate the story using the same patterns, investors will be much more likely to accept your assertions. It's the easiest way to learn to talk the talk without going to business school.

h2. Fiction vs. reality

One caveat of structuring your startup as a story is that it's so effective that it's easy to deceive yourself with early success. Smart and sufficiently determined entrepreneurs can turn almost any idea into a story. If you're committed to building a food delivery service, you can always invent a hypothesis, weave a narrative about your product around it, and polish your pitch until a large number of people believe it. Unfortunately you will have created very compelling fiction.

It's relatively easy to attract a surprising amount of capital, talent, and press interest to your company this way, which makes the technique extremely dangerous. I've met people who burned through millions of dollars of other people's money and wasted hundreds of man-years on projects because they've inadvertently created very compelling fictions and were sufficiently taken by early success to believe in their own fiction themselves.

So it isn't just important for the story to be compelling. It's also extremely important for the story to right.
