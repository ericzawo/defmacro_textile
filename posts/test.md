## Title ##

A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon
seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her
violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I
could not help but love and cherish her.

Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
gone before.

To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an
unprecedented duel with nature could one dream of anything more?

The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly!
